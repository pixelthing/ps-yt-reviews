okay so here we are on the new Polestar

- how quick is it let's find out three

two one

but hang on before we get to that point

let's cover what this car actually is

first if you're unfamiliar with the

badge Polestar started life as the

performance arm of Volvo but it's been

turned into an electric focused brand in

its own right giving us so far the pole

star 1 which is a limited edition

massively expensive plug-in hybrid super

coupe a but the car we're driving today

is the fully electric Polestar to

something with much more mass-market

appeal mainly because it doesn't cost

140,000 pounds like the Polestar 1

instead it's 50,000 pounds and is said

to offer 292 miles from a full charge

that's a lot of miles it's still a lot

of money but it does mean that this is

the only true direct competitor against

the Tesla Model 3 and while we're on the

subject of money don't forget go to watt

calm to save a load of cash of your next

new car in fact you can save 4,000

pounds off the Volvo XC 40 family SUV

which is the car that the Polestar 2

shares its underpinnings with but you

can see it's been sculpted into more of

a saloon with a slightly jacked up

stance now it might not have a Volvo

badge on the nose but you'd be pretty

confident if you had to guess which

manufacturer helped inspire the design

of this car but there are some unique

non volvo design features like these

frameless door mirrors and a full width

light bar at the back of the car the

interior is a bit more of a departure

from Volvo's other models certainly more

so than in a Polestar one which is

essentially a Volvo s90 inside but here

it does feel different although you

might recognize the steering wheel the

buttons and the stalks from Volvo's

other models but elsewhere it does have

a different feel so you've got this

rising center console which goes up to

this big new 11 inch touchscreen

infotainment system now this is

something that's been developed with

Android and it basically means that

rather than having Volvo's own interface

you have what is essentially Android

auto straight away so you've got Google

Maps you've got Google assistant and

that you can hold on to these icons and

move them around on the screen to

customise it a little bit nice

big icons that are easy to hit of course

we'd rather have some physical buttons

to help use it on the move but at least

these are nicely sized and it's really

bright quick to respond another plus is

that you have a digital driver display

whereas in the model 3 you just got that

one massive screen in the middle so even

if you want to see how fast you're going

in the Tesla you've got to take your

eyes away from the road and look at the

screen in the middle but here it's all

in front of you just like in a

traditional car and you've also got the

option to change to a few different

views and whichever one you go for it's

nice and easy to see so that's really

good and the general feel in here is

really impressive it's not the cheapest

car in the world but it does back that

up with really good quality inside yes

there is a bit of flex on this center

console bit here but otherwise the

materials feel good this wood effect is

done nicely it's got a nice squishy

dashboard there are some cheaper

plastics like around the door handle

here but otherwise it's got a really

nice feel up front in the back of the

Polestar - there's good bits and there's

bad bits the best bit is the legroom

because there's absolutely loads of it

you can see even the tallest of

passengers will have plenty of space for

their legs you also get a standard fit

panoramic sunroof which gives the

feeling of airiness back here however

Headroom isn't particularly generous so

you can see if you're just under 6 foot

as I am you can't really sit perfectly

straight without feeling a little bit

cramped and there's a fairly harsh angle

on the roof lining here which does cut

into the space available so that's not

particularly impressive

similarly you've got this really big

central hump in the middle of the floor

as well so if you're sat in the middle

you're gonna have to put your legs

either side there so compared to a model

3 that car offers more of everything

really it has similarly generous legroom

but better Headroom and it's easier to

fit three people in the back of the boot

isn't especially generous but still a

decent size for a big shop or family

holiday luggage and there's a bit of

storage in the front as well a model 3

will fit more in but one thing the

Polestar does have over its Tesla rival

is the fact that it's a hatchback rather

than a saloon so it's easier to load

some big bulky items into

so the Polestar 2 is impressive inside

but what are we dealing with on the road

well it gets a 78 kilowatt-hour

lithium-ion battery and 2 electric

motors one on the front axle and one on

the rear axle and it produces 402 brake

horsepower and 487 pounds foot of torque

but an important number to throw in here

is the weight of this car it is 2123

kilograms which is a lot it's about 300

kilograms more than a Tesla Model 3 and

almost as much as a Range Rover heavy

indeed but the good news is that it's

not immediately obvious behind the

wheels that the Polestar tune is a bit

of a porker because the acceleration on

offer is really impressive it does that

classic electric car thing of as soon as

you sniff the accelerator it absolutely

catapults you down the road although you

can only really disguise the weight in a

straight line and you do meet the corner

there's quite a lot of body lean you can

feel it working hard trying to shift

this weight and there's plenty of grip

but it just doesn't have that kind of

natural feeling of aGeelyty that a Tesla

Model 3 has and that's to do with the

steering as well because in the Polestar

- it's a little bit dead around centre

so in the Tesla every input feels really

really alert and it gives it that

feeling of aGeelyty but you don't really

have that in a Polestart - there are a

few different settings you can have for

the steering you can put it in light

standard or firm to be honest there

isn't really a huge difference between

standard or firm it doesn't improve

things dramatically so that isn't

necessarily a strength of the car

compared to the model 3 one pedal

driving so that essentially increases

the level of regenerative braking to a

point where when you lift off the

accelerator you can bring the car to a

complete stop and obviously you might

not want to be using that on track but

it means around town it's a nice

relaxing addition to the car and it

means that it's really easy to drive it

smoothly especially at low speeds but

one thing that isn't quite so good is

the brake pedal itself so when you do

need to use it there's quite a bit of

dead travel in it so it doesn't feel

particularly natural although the one

pedal solution is so good that you might

she hardly ever had to use that brake

pedal and you can adjust the setting for

the one peddle driving as well so you

can have it on standard which is where

when you lift off it will eventually

slow you down to a complete halt or you

can have it on low or off completely

similarly you can adjust creep mode so

when you're on the brakes

if you lift off with creep mode on just

like in a Model 3 it will help move the

car forwards as if you were driving a

normal petrol automatic or something and

while this car hails from Gothenburg

it's spent a lot of its time on

Yorkshire roads to help tune its ride

the result

well it's comfortable for the most part

speed bumps and general Road undulations

are absorbed nicely but things like

potholes and expansion joints send a

shadow rippling through the car with

lots of suspension noise to go with it

the model 3 is more controlled and more

comfortable ok so here we are on the new

Polestar - how quick is it let's find

out 3 2 1

oh it's quick and there we go 60 miles

an hour Wow properly wrap it so a big

heavy car but it really doesn't feel it

in a straight - it's super impressive

naught to 60 miles per hour is

dispatched in just 4.5 seconds sure not

a match for the ridiculous 3.2 seconds

you get from a model 3 performance but

still enough to embarrass most sports

cars if you're not doing drag races and

driving normally you should be able to

cover 292 miles from a full charge a

useful range although the same WL TP

certified figure for the model 3 long

range suggests it will go 50 miles

further and when you need to charge up

the Polestar you'll get a nought to 80%

charge in 40 minutes from a 150 kilowatt

charger but the challenge will be

actually finding one of those from a

more commonplace 50 kilowatt charger 20

to 80% is done in one hour

but as far as infrastructure goes

nothing can come close to Teslas

excellent supercharger network what

about pricing the Polestar 2 is priced

from 49 thousand nine hundred pounds in

the UK at launch and that's significant

because it just sneaks in under 50,000

pounds which means in the UK you get

three thousand pounds off the cost of it

from the UK government as part of the

plug-in

and there are also cheaper versions of

this car that will join along its

lifetime so right now the Tesla Model 3

might have it beaten in the numbers game

but there's still lots to like about the

Polestar - especially it's really really

nice interior and it's an excellent

acceleration why so closely to a model 3

it may not be the ultimate winner but

compared to much more expensive cars

like the Jaguar ipace and the Audi

e-tron the Polestar 2 looks very

compelling so that was our first taste
