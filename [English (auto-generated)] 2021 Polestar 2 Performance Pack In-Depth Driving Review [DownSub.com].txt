hello and welcome to another out of spec

reviews video in this video we will be

reviewing the Polestar 2 in a mix of

driving scenarios but i also wanted to

let you know this is the start of our

september special across all of out of

specs channels the majority of our

videos i can't guarantee everyone but

most of them will be fully focused on

electric vehicles so this is sort of

september electrified we'll have a ton

of fun videos coming for you by the time

you watch this video i'll be in munich

germany driving a whole bunch of weird

wacky cool and wild evs all across doing

top speed tests on the autobahn and

seeing a whole bunch of new evs and

different cars that won't even make it

here to the us in today's video though

we're starting off all the fun with the

star 2 with performance pack

now there's a pretty interesting reason

why the Polestar 2 is in here right now

we only have a short period of time with

it and i really want to get you all of

the best driving impressions and

Polestar 2 with performance pack comes

with really cool adjustable olean

stampers we've tested them on other cars

v60 polestar xc60 polestar etc

however the Polestar 2 has similar shock

adjustments but in the rear time in how

would you say that it is

so honestly not that bad you take out

two things pull the

wheel liner back and then you take a top

hat off and just twist it right so not

not that bad to adjust the rear but it

does need to go up on a jack and then

you can dial in the suspension what

we're doing now is dialing it into their

track settings so setting one in the

front and setting two in the rear out of

20. so full stiff we're gonna take it

out on the canyons at the beginning of

this video before we do that though join

me around this way i want to tell you a

little bit about the car show you around

it while timing's working on it again

i've already done a range test on this

vehicle that's live on inside ev's us

youtube channel and we'll have a

charging test coming probably tomorrow

on this channel so part of our coverage

is testing evs part of our coverage is

reviewing them and seeing if they're

good to drive or buy et cetera but here

is the Polestar 2 this particular one

neares makes no difference 65 plus

thousand dollars the way it's kitted out

it's a 2021 which means it does not have

the updates that 2022 will have for 2022

there will be a front-wheel drive only

version and then there will also be you

know the same all-wheel drive version

here but with the addition of a heat

pump so maybe slightly more efficient

anyway i did the range testing here on

the performance pack probably the worst

version of Polestar 2 you can get for

range because of the big wheels

some say it's a sedan that's what pole

star says i say it's more of an suv or a

hatchback take a look at this rear

opening you can see quite large and come

out and take a look at the trunk space

you can see really big there's some

innovative you know sort of storage

solutions under here very similar to a

lot of volvo stuff but

of course it's not a volvo it's a pole

star which is volvo's electric arm but

volvo's also going all electric don't

ask me how that makes any sense i don't

know i'm here to just review the car

looks great i think um

inside we'll talk about it when we go

for a drive

time in setting it down we're going to

adjust the other damper over here we'll

get it on the road and we'll talk more

about the pull star too so i adjusted

the suspension all the way so the

easiest way to do is just go all the way

to one and then go one click back so

that you're at two so you don't have to

count every single click you make so now

we're just lowering it it's in its track

setup so that's two in the rear one in

the front

and

kyle's gonna have some fun and we only

have to do this two more times

throughout this test

wouldn't it be nice if they were

electrically controlled but that would

lose the flare i feel like it's special

doing it this way here and just have an

extension piece

right well what's nice about the v60

polestar and volvo stuff with the same

dampers is you can do it at the top of

the

um stop of the strut under the hood but

these are mounted upside down

so you have to do it at the bottom

i like it i think it's cool you guys are

always complaining about how dirty my

car is in videos and a company called ev

wash has reached out to solve this

problem this is a reusable sustainable

washing system that's branded

specifically towards evs take a look at

this it comes in this really nice

carrying case i can open it up i have

all of the towels i need all of the

different equipment i need for example

glass cleaner and when this really nice

bottle runs out that you can purchase a

refillable 100 biodegradable refill pack

fill up your bottle and that way it's

much more sustainable than normal car

cleaning products ev wash use the code

out of spec 30 for 30 off your order

link is in the description

you join me in the pulse star 2 and

because i have the

napa leather option i think it's four or

five grand i get cooled seats so that's

kind of nice so at least ventilated in

this case um before we go and just drive

it already you know having the dampers

turned up to track mode just a massive

difference here wow uh so i can't wait

to experience this car in the back road

genuinely have not driven it fast yet

and as a sporty sedan electric suv

hatchback thing uh i'm really excited

this car is right up my alley right so

it's electric it's cool it's modern it's

swedish design it looks cool gets a lot

of attention it's premium but it's not

pretentious very similar to volvo

products the reason i love

volvo so much almost every vehicle there

and you know while this isn't a volvo

everything kind of feels like a volvo

and that's a great thing the climate

control knobs are straight out of all

though everything is the same you know

it's got the Polestar our design

steering wheel the really thick rim love

it love the design in here

before i you know just go on and geek

about this car there's a couple things

we need to talk about first off the

specs price uh this one's about 65 grand

the way it's kitted out so we have uh

you know a maxed out pulse star to every

option available this car has so

performance pack the driver assistance

pack the

luxury all the all the stuff the napa

seats right the gold seat belts come in

the performance pack it has all that

two electric motors 150 kilowatts each

identically sized permanent magnet

motors

so under wide open acceleration you

don't have more of a rear bios system

it's actually equal power front and rear

i think that's pretty interesting we

haven't seen that from many evs

many evs have a larger rear motor and a

smaller front motor to give you a little

bit of sense of oversteer a little bit

more rear bias control and so to me that

feels a little bit conflicting with

giving you the big breaks and the crazy

suspension but then we'll see how it's

tuned we'll see how it feels coming in

and out of corners um in terms of

competitors you have volkswagen id4

all-wheel drive or gtx on the lower end

much lower performance level not nearly

as as designed to be as

handling crazy of course you have its

own brother xc40 recharge you have um

what else is in there mustang maki i

think would be the main competitor

performance oriented uh sort of

all-wheel drive vehicle but um i'm not

comparing this car to any of those we're

just going to be looking at the polestar

2 as one holistic package today and then

in the future if you guys would like

we'll review some other ones

let's talk

what do we have battery pack stuff 78

kilowatt hour gross i think 75 kilowatt

hour usable at least that's when the car

was new it's received a few software

updates over time that have really

improved the car and improved the

driving i remember i was one of the

first to drive pulse star 2 in the us

and it was good and i wrote a nice

review and made some videos about it

and i said you know

there's still room for improvement

through software and guess what pollstar

actually stuck to their word and made

these software improvements

as they went on so that's a really

important thing there's one one side of

it is an automaker can say we support

over-the-air updates and we will do them

and then actually doing them and

pulstar's been doing them and quite

frequently every month or two based off

the history of this car so that's

impressive

um

just as a side note build quality feels

amazing material usage inside is

absolutely gorgeous very tasteful

between this sort of natural wood grain

with these modern textures i really love

the interior design i love the exterior

design something about the c pillar real

word doesn't do it for me i don't like

this sloping down design i kind of wish

it continued more of a wagon hatchbacky

feel for me having two big dogs that

would be helpful but the rear seats fold

down it wouldn't be a problem at all

another note about the battery pack is

for me two things are very important

about an ev which are the overall range

of the vehicle if you go back to our

range test this did about 225 miles

nears makes no difference at 70 miles an

hour i think that's great so highway

range is north of 220 miles uh that to

me is pretty good however the charging

curve that we tested

was not so good you'll see that tomorrow

it wasn't terrible it really isn't it's

livable but um you know zero to eighty

percent was fine but when you factor in

a zero to one hundred percent time it

was just about two hours and that's

about an hour longer than id4 uh and

some other evs that i've tested again

not directly comparing them in the same

areas side by side but just as a

reference the charging based off of my

experience didn't feel that amazing

let's take it up to a mountain road now

that we have it in full maximax and the

suspension i'm feeling really firm i'm

sure there are some owners that are

going to drive it like this um but are

not and and some of you might be

wondering wouldn't it be nice just to

have a suspension control on the screen

well

you have to remember

who olene's are oliens are some of the

most high quality

dampers that you can get in racing

in streetcar especially it's very on the

high end so having this it's north of a

bilstein for example in terms of quality

and having the manual adjustment to me

leads to an air of specialness something

interesting and exciting and knobs you

can turn and i kind of like that you

have to go out of your way to adjust the

suspension uh gives you a much broader

breadth of adjustment than some of these

electric dampers do so we have it in

track mode now let's take it up to the

mountains let's not sit in traffic we'll

do that later on in the video again it's

going to be like an hour long video i

think but hopefully you'll learn a thing

or two about polestar and hopefully i

will as well i have it charged up uh you

know 93 state of charge right now when

we reach the mountains we will uh

probably be a little bit lower than that

but i'll try and drive efficiently so we

can save as much juice for the twisties

we're approaching the mountains

absolutely beautiful day it is toasty 90

degrees so here are some of the things

that i'm going to be looking for on this

performance test i'm going to be looking

for mainly uh power duration so even

here at 90 state of charge i can't even

use all the region available i can see

part of that display is grayed out and

that's just because the battery's pretty

full it can't accept a ton of current

going into it when it's high however

very few cars really i can only think as

tesla being the only one where you're

not able to use full regen

this does have one pedal driving i will

be driving with it in the strongest

setting i'm also gonna put steering into

standard i generally don't like an over

uh heavy steering but i don't like over

assistance either creep mode is off for

low speed we are to run esc sport mode

once i take it off pilot assist so

we'll have it in all kind of the sporty

settings there's no full traction

control off but there is esc sport mode

one last thing before we get into it i

wanted to talk a little bit more about

the charging um Polestar says this car

will do 150 kilowatt peak charging we

found that to be true but we only found

it from about zero to ten percent state

of charge and then after that it really

tapered down so for me and road tripping

um

it didn't really

have a meaty center of the pack it

charged really fast and then died and

kind of sat there the top end of the

pack wasn't terrible above 90 though it

really cuts down to be expected the

thing with pulstar is it's not like

e-tron where there's massive buffers uh

buffers top and bottom of the battery

pack so you can charge 150 kilowatts all

the way to 80

here in this car you're they're actually

allowing you to use most of the battery

pack so it is going to have to taper up

top nice thing is

you have a really cool charge limit

display so you can adjust the car in 10

increments to uh stop charging from 40

to 100 percent uh

90 every day i would probably do 80 on

mine and if i'm going away on vacation i

would run it down plug it in at 40 and

just keep it plugged in batteries don't

like to be very high charged when you

leave them for a while also

importantly this car is a 48 amp onboard

charger so that's what 12 kilowatts

something like that ac charging so if

you have a home charger because this is

quite a large battery pack and actually

last night i finished the range test and

was out again early this morning and had

a 100 charge and that's all thanks to

the 48 amp on-board charger allowing me

to get chargers and thankfully though

you can adjust your amperage uh level

intake in one amp increments i believe

down to five amps and that's so

important and so many evs miss this

where um you know some of them like id4

really only just have a limit amperage

draw

tesla and this i think are the only ones

that really let you go 48 amps 47 amps

46 amps max and that's perfect because i

have an adapter that goes from tesla to

j1772 that's limited to 40 amps and i'm

able to use that adapter set the car to

40 amps max like it is now and uh i

don't actually overheat the adapter or

push it past its design limits so let's

just try some handling here oh

big difference i can't wait to get this

up the hill it's going to be a little

bit trafficky today but we'll find

little spurts to open it up and the

other thing i wanted to mention was the

google ui here in this car it's really

well done it does a fairly good job of

routing charging stations uh for shorter

trips so from like here in fort collins

going to salt lake city it can do and it

routed that but if i try to go to la or

new york that's too long of a distance

for it to automatically add charger so

i'd say it's good it's been getting

better because when i tested Polestar 2 a

year ago

it wouldn't even automatically route

chargers so

things are getting better also

importantly when it says uh the

percentage that you'll get to your

destination first of all it says that

that's awesome but it's also

extremely accurate uh every single time

i've put a destination in this car and i

drove like a sane person like i would

normally driving around i arrived at the

destination with exactly the amount of

electricity that the car predicted i

would have left that is really

impressive i can't even say that for any

other automaker it's really blown me

away actually i've had some friends with

me too we're like all right let's try

this out

really really good uh

energy usage prediction here you can

also download more apps from the google

android store you can use your phone as

a key i tried to set it up but i didn't

have admin access to the car so i wasn't

able to but either way it's nice that

you're able to do these things i love

the ui in this car love the center

display i hope through software you're

able to do more and more things with it

but what a great snappy quick intuitive

interface with great amount of control

over your settings and your information

i'm just really totally blown away by

the integration of everything so let's

try and get past some of these cars rip

it up some back roads and see how she

does when we turn it up

to 11 or 12.

arriving here at the base of the canyons

with 87 state of charge this 4runner's

actually getting it pretty hard in front

of us

that was awesome he just threw it into

that corner so let's see how he can do

for sure the Polestar can keep up we

are on summer performance tires thanks

to pulstar's 2 performance pack here at

this particular tester and this is good

you know we'll we'll get past some of

this traffic here in a little bit but

let's just start to feel out the car

first of all let's talk throttle

application and acceleration the

throttle is

very sharp and i'm not sure if that's a

good thing i sort of like a long pedal

travel a pretty progressive input and

here it's almost as if there's just a

half a second

delay

based off of what i'm doing like there's

this sharp point that i'm hitting that

just is like oh power power and it's

instant and so it's really good when you

put your friends in the car and you boot

it and it's like whoa

and it's quick i want to say 450

horsepower 430 horsepower or something

like that 300 kilowatts of power

combined system output and uh here at 86

state of charge you know it makes most

of that it's really awesome the battery

pack in Polestar 2 is actually really high

voltage pack so 440 450 volts full and

about 385 390 dead that's almost like

e-tron levels of high voltage which is

awesome because it means there's less

current needed to reach your desired

power output which means in theory less

heat loss so we'll see about power

derailing when we drive it hard we may

have to pull over and let some of these

people go up ahead um i think we'll just

slow down here a little bit get a sense

for the feeling so throttle is strong

and it's a little bit sharp and it's a

little bit snappy

but i don't know if that's a bad thing i

think a lot of people would like that

for me i just wish it was tuned a little

bit more progressively this car does

have the newer software update that does

allow for smoother motor control man

when you go wide open throttle this

thing is surely capable let's lean it

into this corner esc sport mode on

under steer city on power

so it's really good

until you try and crank it out of a

corner

let me tell you what i just felt through

that corner it was an awesome turning

when you get this thing into a corner it

uses all of that front tire but the rear

just feels like it's along for the ride

that was just that corner we'll see how

it feels through the rest steering feel

is great steering ratio is fantastic i'm

really into the steering on this car

actually let's try firm a little bit too

firm light is yeah way too light

standard

that's for me big power wow no denying

power

you don't need any more than this that's

for sure it's more than enough to have

some fun with the thing that i wish i

could do a little bit more of was when i

nail it out of a corner this is where i

would want that larger rear motor and a

smaller front motor it plows a little

bit and there's also quite a bit of

torque steer so to actually unwind the

steering wheel and go back to an

on-center position i'm noticing that

i have to actually physically pull the

wheel back center which is something i

can't say i've experienced in many cars

let's slow down through here and pick up

the pace again a little bit i mean you

get the sense that this thing's working

for sure but man is it quick and it's a

weapon

um i can't wait to try out these brakes

a little bit more because that seems to

be just an incredible brake pedal that

i've never felt this level of brake

pedal blending in neevy other than

maybe tycon turbo s so

with carbon ceramics that's pretty

awesome struck it into this corner

a little bit understeer but actually the

back was coming around there so maybe if

you just stay in it and you're

persistent it'll be kind of fun overall

definitely gives the impression of

performance it's definitely fast it's

definitely serious when you turn the

dampers up that's the important thing

here we are now in the levels of

seriously good suspension design when it

comes to evs and that is just a great

thing to have here in the pull star um

what's kind of cool is i get this gauge

on my screen that shows power and regen

and then when i touch the brake pedal

it'll show me how much i'm blending the

friction breaks in which i really really

really enjoy so what i'm going to do is

come to a stop up here we'll let traffic

get ahead and then we'll actually drive

this thing pretty properly

and see how it feels when we push it

because all indications lead to

maybe not a very spicy over steering

drifty kind of car but certainly one

that is

enthusiasts in nature

predictable easy to drive quick and it's

not going to scare you if you get it

mixed up

you kind of just you know it diverts the

understeer here so

let's just pull over here for a second

let everyone get ahead and i'll catch up

with you in a minute we're approaching

some of the best corners here on this

road so launching off the line big power

gives full power at 38 miles an hour

that's when it feeds it all the way in

so let's try it out normally i actually

prefer a softer car on the street and

such hard suspension dampening isn't

always great on the road sometimes

softer is faster i don't know if that's

the case here wow you can carry

some crazy speeds through here you've

got to be kidding me that is

impressively quick

wow um all right so when you really get

up Polestar 2

does it handle really well the best part

about an ev is you can drive like your

hair is on fire and no one knows you're

coming because you're not making any

noise

absolutely love that so far i've been

doing a lot of sort of hard

accelerations and hard regens no sense

of power cut that's impressive let's go

wide open throttle up this way

still giving me full power man is it

quick up top

definitely a little dies a little bit up

top like uh some evie certainly do but

this wasn't like uh anything else so

that was cool that was the forerunner

driver she was awesome

she gave us a thumbs up there and

really really impressive throttle

control impressive thermal longevity for

an eevee already and that's more than

it's gotten better than when i drove it

the first time is what i'm trying to say

back to wide open throttle

oh wow

okay i am really impressed here uh so

many other evs would have thermal

throttled at this point that make this

much power so

props to pulstar for tuning out even

some of the thermal throttling that i

experienced early on you've definitely

optimized your package here

wow

you can carry some serious

speed through some of these corners now

it's not

really set up the way i would personally

prefer it i like a car to move around on

the back axle and the back axle on this

is really planted

you can definitely tell they took the

approach let's try the brakes really

quick

my eyeballs just got pulled out of my

face

great braking performance here with the

brembos there's a squirrel in the road

don't want to hit it

that's great when you have suspension

set in track mode you can just

and it just darts around really good

suspension calibration uh here but again

that back end is firm so effective

more aggressive than most people will

ever need on the street again that's why

it's called the track setting

and i'm really loving this package it's

interesting it's unlike anything i've

driven because

it's so aggressive in setup yet so

little oversteer it's so balanced and

neutral that you can just throw this

thing around corners

it goes really really well

um efficiency isn't terrible either

that's crazy i mean we just went hard

throttle up the hill i've used less than

10 percent state of charge in many other

evs i would have burned through more

juice than that so

call me impressed here with this car's

level of capability when driving it

quickly wow

i don't even hear fans on

air conditioning is running great

sometimes when you drive evs hard the ac

cuts out

oh boy so really

the main

negative with this car for me

is just the charging curve

if that could be improved

i might buy one

because everything else is so good sound

system is good not great wish we got the

bowers and wilkins like pulstar one had

that's a great system

but it's more than acceptable

hard power down through here

wow does it put on the speed

there are you need some serious power up

here at this altitude in a combustion

vehicle to keep up with this thing

it just freaking

i mean i won't say the number but

whoa

standing on the brake pedal throwing it

in one pedal drive calibration is really

good yeah firm over the bump

i would actually back it a couple

notches off of track mode for street use

if it were me

but boy can you hammer this thing around

over the crest

best section of the road right through

here hard power

holy

this is like built to carve up a back

road

very few

very few evs and combustion cars

can drive at this level of competence

standing on the brakes that's good nice

abs calibration as well i was able to

just get it right on threshold braking

and no sense of thermal throttling are

you kidding me i've been driving this

car hard still giving me full power

now at a lower state of charge that

might not be the case but up here at

high state of charge

yeah there's a little bit of thermal

throttle

a hint

but i've seen it like in early days when

i first tested this car it thermal

throttle to the point where the gauge

was like sorry you can't really have any

more

they have optimized the hell out of this

chassis let's test it on some of these

tight corners big power

that's the understeer that's where i

want the big rear motor to pivot the car

around and rock it forwards but does it

climb up this hill better than almost

anything i've tested up here oh yes

and the motor sound good

look there are

evs that

won't make it up here without thermal

throttling 10 miles back on the road

oh and it's still pulling and there are

combustion vehicles sports cars that

will not make it up that hill driving as

hard as i was just driving on a 80 plus

degree day 90 degrees at the bottom

and this just rocketed up oh my goodness

am i impressed i think maybe adjusting

some sway bars in the aftermarket things

like this would allow the car to rotate

a little bit more

but look as far as a weapon goes for a

keen driver who's you know if you're

interested in speed and performance

oversteer is not the answer it's more

just fun and experience this is actually

quick driving um

wow

[Music]

this

this performance driving might redeem

that charging curve

it might just redeem that charging curve

that i'm speechless i've very few cars

have driven that handle that well up

here for something that weighs this much

and is like built on volvo cma

architecture which is compact modular

architecture this is like xc40 is built

on this like normal pedestrian mob

mobiles and then you just hand the

suspension to uh olene's and say good

luck

make something magical

they've made something magical

oh wow am i impressed and blown away

truly blown away

i knew it was going to be good i didn't

know it was going to be this good

can i just end the review there do i

need to tell you anything more

no we're just getting started

the fact is Polestar 2 with performance

pack

is

i really don't even know what to say

that never happens when have you ever

heard me stop talking

holy smokes

impressive

so we just finished the hard blast up on

my canyon loop i do this loop almost

every day in a whole bunch of different

cars and it's usually pretty predictable

but wow was this impressive you can hear

the fans are going

so they definitely are running to cool

the drivetrain i mean we definitely ran

it hard enough to kick on the fans but

holy smokes can this thing

run hard

and run for a while it's not

wow that's that's impressive that's hard

on a car i don't know how to explain to

you how hard that is look at how good it

looks up here too may as well take the

time and show you a little bit around

the car while we're just taking a little

break you can see no pull star badging

on the car anywhere

nice boot space

looks pretty good under here all feels

very normal very volvo actually i hate

to say volvo in this review but it's

true

of course we talked about charging on

the way j1772

then ccs here

little pin

i would take that cover off on my car

very european as you have to push this

button to unlock the charger it doesn't

really listen to the latch on the j1772

port typical for euro evs

back seats good heated rear seats

glass roof no shade even on hot days i

haven't found it to be a problem

it's been good

really love the wheel tire combination

on this actually maybe i would

personally go with like a pilot sport 4s

but continental sport contacts seem to

fit the car pretty well

once they get some heat to them they

really grip and do well when they're

cold though they kind of are like bricks

but that's the nature of a summer

performance tire

interior up front

obviously

stellar

just beautiful

wish you know if they were going the

luxury way though i wish they would give

you the

electrically adjusting thigh bolster

here like the inscription volvos have

it's in the parts catalog the bowers and

wilkins sound system the aluminum pedals

it does not feel

all the way premium but it does feel

reasonable given that this car is priced

a little bit less than those vehicles

and it's a full battery electric

so

let's head back to the garage i'm going

to have a great time shredding it back

down the canyon of course i'll let you

know how if how the brakes hold up on

the way down when we get back to the

house we'll put the suspension in normal

and we'll take it for a cruise around

town all right heading back down the

hill shall we do another launch i don't

believe there's like a launch control

programming left foot hard on the brake

flooring it doesn't do anything

oh it launches hard pretty that

this thing boogies i gotta say how is it

performing this well

and there's

near triple digits just

it really is the perfect level of

performance in terms of acceleration for

this class of vehicle

i am just blown away i keep saying that

wow

wow

great chassis control predictable

i think i want to back it down a bit if

i had it longer i'd go a couple notches

back for a back road

see you back at the garage i'll test the

brakes out on the way thermal management

system is blowing me away though truly

blowing me away we are now back in the

garage with the Polestar 2 after driving

it up that awesome road and we are

putting the suspension from full track

to full comfort we're gonna get the

night and day feeling here the reason

we're doing comfort now and then we'll

put it to nominal which is sort of how

they're delivered and how we want to

return the car back to Polestar because

that's the way it came to us um is

so we don't have to adjust it twice we

just have to do it one more time after

this and then we'll do normal so we're

actually going to hop on the highway now

and then we'll drive it around town

later on we got it charging back up we

burned quite a bit of juice on that

drive to be expected driving it hard but

have to say considering the

harshness of driving i guess is how i

would put it it actually did pretty well

from a thermal management perspective

the Polestar 2 also has a frunk let me

show you

opening up the door here i'm gonna pull

on this little tab once

it's going to open the front

and

let's see it's over here in the right i

believe

yep

and it opens up

interestingly

with the volvo logo you can always just

follow the uh line up and then you'll

reach the hood latch release but here it

is and this is the mobile connector that

comes included

with your

Polestar 2. this is actually really

nice take a look at this thing so you

have this sort of circular style

connector and then you have a nema 1450

pigtail and a 110 outlet that can attach

onto here that's awesome i love that

they give you a nema 1450 big win very

few evs do this

that's awesome and what a nice solution

in this small thing i think it's only 32

amps but it's all you need gotta love it

that's sweet so timing we're gonna go

all the way clockwise and then 20 clicks

to the left how does that sound

easiest cake easiest cake i mean it's

not as easy as like

just hitting up electrically adjustable

comfort button but it does add to the

experience

well but i don't understand what are you

supposed to do just pull over before a

back road i guess so just keep a jack in

the back

[Laughter]

i have Polestar 2 in sort of max

comfort mode now i haven't driven it yet

pulling out of the driveway

oh already smoother

incredible like that first little nick

out of the driveway let's head on to the

highway and see how this thing cruises

try some of the driver assistance stuff

and then we'll get into the nitty-gritty

brake pedal blending i don't think i

mentioned too well uh during the

mountain drive but one of my biggest

standouts of this car there were three

of course one was just the sheer

cornering speed not the way that it

oversteers out of a corner but it was

very neutral uh and it just hammered

through once you got heat in the tires

uh the second thing i really loved of

course was the brake pedal

feel and calibration i didn't really

talk about this it's very hard to

distinguish when it blends in friction

breaks i have to say they've done a

stellar job really the only thing

as good as this is tycon with carbon

ceramics just incredible and then

the other thing i really loved was the

thermal management of course overall

incredible on a mountain but let's see

what it's like cruising in comfort mode

i will say off the bat it's very

quiet driving around near silent

experience

still hammers just as well though

as we make our way over to the highway i

wanted to show you this this is the pole

star key

and it's

really not nice

like really not nice um i don't know if

this is the main key or the spare key

but every time i've driven a pull start

this is the key they give me and it's

like

the spare key for a ball though it's

really light totally plasticky

man is it just ugly and it doesn't feel

nice the inscription volvos use the same

key but they're leather wrapped and so

much nicer and i think

leads to a more premium

that key is not nice uh does it matter

to me yes

but to most people probably not

uh we're on a really rough point of

tarmac here on pavement and it is dead

quiet compared to most other cars it's

very interesting

how well insulated this car is

and even more so how few squeaks and

rattles there are a lot of new cars

don't have squeaks and rattles but

there's a sense that this is just

screwed together really

well more so than most any other

car i've driven i mean

most new cars don't squeak a rattle but

this really doesn't have any noise it's

just

very solid feels like it's carved out of

one piece and it honestly feels better

built than most other cars out of uh

geely group that i've driven so let's

jump on the highway just up ahead here

get it up to speed and try some of the

driver assistance stuff

so about to merge on the highway we'll

give it the beans getting on here we go

a little delay off the line little lag

power down

man does this thing just rock it up to

speed no question

uh very different character of vehicle

now with the suspension back down i

don't want to pretend and say it's soft

it's not it's still

a firm car with the suspension backed

off but what it does is it seemed to

have taken the edge off going into

polestar's comfort setting and i would

say it's more than fine to daily drive

for most people but if you live in an

area with really bumpy roads

it's still pretty firm you know at the

end of the day it's a performance

oriented vehicle kind of rides as such

however here on the highway

eats the miles up

i actually drove this car yesterday last

night on a range test with the

suspension set at nominal which is eight

clicks back we're 18 clicks back and 20

in the rear right now so big difference

and i thought it was very comfortable in

the highway still firm over the bumps

but more than adequate for a long trip

and i still think the same thing here

we're going to bring the speed up to 80

miles per hour i've activated Polestars

pilot assist so there's two different

levels of assistance i can click the

right arrow and i can go just on

adaptive cruise control like i am right

now or if i click the right arrow again

it will re-engage pilot assist the pilot

assist is using a sort of single camera

reading the lines is a very

basic level 2 driver assistance system i

think is all that you need personally so

it doesn't do lane changes i click my

turn signal on move the car over i don't

have to re-engage it re-engages

automatically which is one of the best

features for sure and look it does a

great job of just staying in its lane on

the highway this is pretty much how i

drive this thing i've done a lot of

highway miles in this car now

and

just pilot assist everywhere it's

stellar even with the sun at low angles

i've been very very impressed you do

have different following distances here

i believe let's see one two three four

five of them uh one it actually gets

really close which is important for the

driver assistance system to do what i

want to do now is not touch the steering

wheel so let's see what happens how does

it try and get my attention as sort of a

you know safety driver assistance test

right now no hands on the wheel no

warnings whatsoever i got my first

warning it says hold steering wheel with

a picture of hands like this while i'm

monitoring not gonna hold the wheel now

it's gone red and it's dinging at me

alright let's see what happens next no

one's around

still dinging at me

it says canceled resume active driving

emergency stop assist is activated it's

steering but it's slowing me down it's

just coasting right now it's actually

applying a little throttle oh a break

there another break there another break

trying to get my attention another break

that one's around another break now it's

hard breaking and i think it's just

going to bring me down to a stop

and yep we've got to accelerate because

there's a truck coming behind big power

that's awesome i love that it tries to

warn you over and over it breaks to get

your attention it's not nearly as

aggressive as volvo's breaking or excuse

me it's the same as volvo system it's

not nearly as aggressive as audi's

braking that just like hawks on the

brakes like

and i think that warps rotors so very

impressed here with the driver

assistance system i can reactivate pull

pilot assist so i'm not in like

autopilot jail

and cruise right back down the highway

again it's very important that systems

try to get your attention if you don't

touch the wheel in case you have a

medical emergency so many cars that we

test just say oh you're not touching the

wheel let me turn that off but it keeps

cruise control going and that to me is

very dangerous so props to Polestar for

designing i would say a much safer

system than most i would love to see

some more uh various types of driver

monitoring here such as eye tracking uh

or even a haptic steering wheel this one

is torque input so it doesn't know if

you're touching the wheel if you're

lightly holding it sometimes it'll ask

you to hold the steering wheel like it

is now i actually need to put a little

bit of steering input into the wheel for

it to recognize but overall the

suspension backed off like this is

comfortable the noise level is very low

the sound system is a six out of ten i

would say i wish it had a little bit

more bass to it a little bit more depth

and clarity and maybe in the future

we'll see them offer their fantastic

bowers and book and sound system and as

a cruiser it's great the only downside

to this car that i can really see

is the charging curve

i actually think it's priced really well

too for 65 grand you get like one of the

most special cool unique cars on the

market anyway let's put the suspension

into nominal into the polestar

recommended setting drive it around the

city talk about the acceleration and

braking characteristics the light or

heavy steering feel and some more ui

stuff and then we'll call it a review

we've arrived back home and listened to

the little reversing sound

just a little thing out the back

sounds pretty funny little chime wow i'm

impressed with it like this i would

never drive it in track mode on the

street i would just turn it up for a

weekend blast now we're gonna set it to

normal mode drive it around town and

then we'll put it in comfort

for the highway portion

but wow

is this thing stellar

on a back road that makes up for like

almost everything about it is just how

well it performs

it's now getting a little bit dark

outside and you join me

in the factory nominal setting as pole

star calls it so

um we'll talk about the suspension in a

bit but let's talk throttle and regen

and regen blending this is something

that a lot of eevee people want to know

about this specifically me that if i was

looking for a car this is what i would

want to know so there's a few different

settings of

one pedal drive the first is one pedal

drive off there's only one

forward motion gear d it doesn't like

have an l or anything and with one pedal

drive off it just coasts so my foot's

off the accelerator pedal i have no

regen no power maybe a hint of regen

just to give you a little bit of a

pullback the gauge just went a hair like

a pixel to the left but pretty much it's

just straight coasting then i touch the

brake pedal it's blending in regen and i

didn't even use friction brakes there so

let's try getting on the brakes a little

bit harder bringing up the speed on the

brake pedal and now it's blending

friction brakes i know this because i

get an orange display that comes in

amazing brake pedal blending here you

can barely

nope you can't feel the the

blending point that is one of the most

impressive braking systems i've ever

experienced in an ev

and i have to say that's just awesome

also special

shout out to the turn signal noise here

really nice turn signal noise it's crisp

it's not loud it's not intrusive it's

just right and it does raise its volume

the faster you're going which i really

enjoy

so that's one pedal drive off you hit

the brake pedal blends in regen and then

it goes friction

then we can go one pedal drive low so as

i lift off the accelerator pedal i get

some regen

as i hit the pedal more it goes more

regen and then blends friction brakes

perfect example here of that red light

one pedal driving low it feels very

similar it feels stronger than a tesla

in low let's go to standard now i also

have creep mode off and auto hold on if

i put creep on

then the car will move forwards if i

come to a stop and push hard on the

brakes then it will still auto hold

awesome programming but if i just come

to a stop with creep normally and lift

off the brake

yeah and i don't push hard on the pedal

then it'll stay the same oh it looks

like this guy next to us wants to race

so we'll try and do something like that

esc sport mode steering and light um

we'll we'll see how that happens but for

now we are one pedal drive and standard

creep off which is how i drive the car

um same thing with auto hold if you push

the brake hard goes to auto hold means

you don't have to keep your foot on the

brake and that's just a great feature so

we'll just nail it from the light say

goodbye to that guy

and that was pretty easy

one of the best parts of this car is

just blowing people away at the lights

really

love that this thing freaking rocks it's

fast so those are your three

one pedal drive settings personally i'm

a standard guy i really like a ton of

regen a ton of the time and there they

go now thinking they won sentra ser

rare car actually pretty hot car for its

time that's pretty neat don't really see

many of those

um

you also have really good headlights

very bright headlights in this car and

like nice headlight startup animations

with the taillight as well i think this

car looks amazing at night with this

beautiful back lighting inside around

all these uh different uh units here

gorgeous car

daytime or nighttime especially at night

time i would say i think volvo and

polestar just do a great job with

tasteful backlighting it's nice now

suspension in nominal this is eight

clicks back front and rear this is you

know how i've been driving the car most

of the time it's how it was delivered to

me

and it feels good probably

a bit too firm for everyday driving if

it was me i would actually drive the car

in comfort

and then just go maybe a couple notches

off of

sport or track

for back road driving it is worth noting

though that pulstar says they were only

responsible for pull star 2 if you drive

it in the pre-selected parameters so if

you do what like i would do if i owned

one which is go a couple notches off

the recommended track setting

i'm guessing your warranty is in

question if you have a suspension issue

i don't know seems a little silly to me

but that's what it says in the handbook

i guess they're just protecting

themselves how would they even know it's

a passive system i don't know but

that's something you know you got to

take into consideration anyway this

thing rocks i have steering feel and

light we have everything in normal one

petal drive on standard and look at how

much regen there is just a ton of regen

and it comes to a stop so nicely and

crisply when it comes down all the way

to zero

so smooth and it just engages auto hold

i mean that is smoother one pedal

driving than tesla not that that's a

comparison but it is

it's better calibration on the d cell

now the throttle

from a start i still think is too

wonky it's almost like there's a little

bit of a lag

so like you can put the pedal down a

little bit but if you go a little bit

harder it like slams the power at you so

foot down a little bit not much

and then like you move it an inch and

it's whoa so i think they need to smooth

that power curve out i mentioned that

when we drove it out in the mountains

it's a little bit

i wouldn't say it's annoying driving

around town some evs have really bad

pedal calibration but it certainly could

use a little bit of smoothing i would

say

um

just to really make it feel refined

right now it just feels a little

a little early production to me i would

say but no motor cogging even at low

speed under high load very little

cogging it you do get a little rumble

but that's natural for permanent magnet

motors to do that um

overall very quiet very refined drive

train especially with some of the

updates in the software i would say it's

just not as good

as

some other evs could be like tycon's

really i think

gold standard for throttle calibration

and foot down you can just rock it away

around town gotta love that

um other than that it's small it's easy

easily maneuverable it's got a great

steering ratio it's like a lock and a

half turn to turn uh i will actually

demonstrate the turning circle for you

up here over this way

and then we'll call it a review how

about that so coming into the corner

here you can see just lightly tapping on

the brakes throwing it in and

accelerating out you can

get across town so quickly in an ev and

so quietly and sort of like no one's

looking at you if you're driving really

fast which really is the best part of an

electric car you just drive crazy so

here we are full turning circle

really good have to say

pretty good lock

wouldn't say it's uh stellar but better

than almost any other small combustion

suv

maybe i should say it's stellar and the

steering returns back to center nicely

the only time the steering doesn't

return back to center is if you're

you're flooring it or you're getting a

lot of power output with lock on the

wheel

then you kind of have to force it to go

back to center

other than that

i think that's a review

i love the ui i love driving this thing

i think it looks really neat especially

up front

people seem to like it

and it just has an air of specialness

it's unlike other things on the road and

i like how swedish the design is it

definitely appeals to my eye and there

you have it the Polestar 2 with

performance pack i hope you enjoyed this

sort of in-depth driving review mixed

with a little bit of information

throughout it's not very heavily focused

on the styling design or interior space

of the pulse star which i believe

there's plenty i'm six foot one i fit in

the rear i fit in the front the rear you

know cargo space is great the front

trunk is great overall i think it's a

really nicely put together package also

while considering the chassis is

designed to handle other types of

propulsion this isn't a ground-up ev the

cma platform handles combustion mild

hybrid plug-in hybrid and full battery

electric

pretty impressive all coming from one

chassis and i think

here is actually one of the best thought

out evs my biggest gripe with this car

and the one of the real things i think

pulstar needs to work on is that

charging curve personally for me it

would actually hold me back from owning

it as my personally owned vehicle you

know replacing my tesla model 3 i would

need 150 kilowatts to at least 40 50

percent and then a nice smooth taper

after that i really hope we're able to

test pulse star 2 again after some more

software updates because i'm sure they

can get that right i also think that

there can be a little bit of work done

with the charging station route planning

doing longer routes pre-conditioning the

battery on the way to the charging

station things like that sort of that

deep level integration i think could use

a little bit more final work but overall

as a polestar's first battery electric

vehicle i think it's a great vehicle

it's certainly a performer really fun if

you're a keen driver if you like to

drift around and do silly stuff this is

not for you but if you actually like

getting down a back road really quickly

this thing can definitely do it i think

it looks the part it feels the part it's

definitely special it's unique if you

want to be a little bit different a

little bit premium give that swedish

vibe to your daily life this is the

answer for sure

i'm very pleased and blown away with

this car just wished it charged a little

bit better and then that would be that

really awesome performer right here
