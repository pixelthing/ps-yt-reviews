hello electro heads and i am back on the

channel unfortunately sorry about that i

filmed a little video a while ago with a

mercedes eqb and some of you said you

wanted me back hiya this man so here i

am today we are doing a video with a

difference today we are looking at

my personal

Polestar 2 and we're going to be

talking all things ownership of the

Polestar 2 what it's like to live with

and any quirks and gimmicks and things i

found out about this car having lived

with it for the past few months so we're

gonna have a little look around at the

spec and then we're gonna go for a

little drive around in london so first

things first then you'll notice it's

black basic things first it is the

performance pack so you'll notice it is

a performance pack because you have

these big brembo gold brakes here and

you have these lovely dust caps as well

and these enormous 20

20 inch wheels that

is married up with some yellow seat

belts as well so you can tell it's

performance pack variety inside as well

you can get a single motor variant you

can get long range as well but this is

actually a dual motor performance pack

variant so it's about 450 odd brake

horsepower and naught to 60 is about 4.8

seconds time to check his source next

time

not only that you've also got olin's

22-way adjustable dampers in there as

well which are unbelievably trick and a

piece of kit that no one could get their

head around

why this was in this car it's an

unbelievable package really really great

and the package only costs about five

thousand pounds so it's actually a lot

of kit for not a lot of money around the

back of the car i don't really know what

to tell you we've got privacy glass a

little light show actually when you lock

and unlock the car so let's have a look

at that

good

that's it

right let's come inside then you'll have

to bear with it's not clean because i

genuinely use this every single day i

have my dogs in it i have my girlfriend

in it uh and

separated so there's some dog fluff and

stuff in here inside then uh come on

come in come here let's have a look

we've also got the pilot pack and we've

also got the premium pack as well so

effectively we've got things like

head-up display automatic driving cruise

control the massive harman kardon hi-fi

as well and these seats actually as well

which i think are made out of kind of

recycled um

litter or something like that something

very green and vegan and eco

so all in all a very nice place in here

i i'm very happy sat here and the

interesting thing about this car

it's google based so you can actually

sign into your google account we'll get

into the tech when we go for a drive i

think that's it for now

actually hold on there's more the back

because some people have friends they

put in the back of these things in the

back i've not actually been in the back

of this before

there is actually an amazing amount of

room looking outside the car it looks

really compact but it's like a tardis

you get in here there's loads of room

look how much movement i'm doing i'm

practicing breaststroke back here i

think that's partly due to the panoramic

roof this roof is essential it's huge

and it gives a really nice sense of

light as well sat upright like this

i've got loads of room look

it's so random and in the middle here

you've got an armrest with some cup

holders you've got climate control

you've got seat heating back here as

well and you've got a cigarette

charger as you know you've got usbc's

back here as well Polestar thought of

it all it's good news i'm actually more

excited about the back of the car than i

thought waffle done then let's go for a

little drive we're actually running a

little bit low on juice so we're gonna

go and find a charging station with the

help of google

off we go then

so

a slight correction to the uh power

output i mentioned earlier this car

actually has 402

brake horsepower is the 300 kilowatt

variant i said about 430 or so earlier i

think 450 odds

what's confused me is there is now a

performance upgrade available for this

car whereby you can i think just

download some software and it puts it up

to 469 brake horsepower so you can get

an extra 70 brake horsepower just by

doing a software upgrade i think that is

only applicable to the dual motor

performance cars like this one that

brings the naught to 60 sprint down to a

very respectable 4.2 seconds down from

4.7 seconds which is no mean feat so i'm

definitely going to be doing that and

that actually is of no concern

whatsoever because the brakes on this

thing i pointed out earlier those big

fat brembos are unbelievable

usually when you talk about adding a

load more power to a car that doesn't

necessarily come with it in the first

place there is concern about the other

components being able to keep up with

that but the brakes are unbelievable so

i'm definitely definitely going to do

that so what's it like to live with

around town

it's unbelievable to drive on country

roads but realistically this is going to

be the sort of driving that people do

with their electric car low speeds

around town kind of just mooching around

and this is the main use that i use this

car for it's a very pleasant place to be

those trick olens dampers really do get

rid of the common gripe that people have

with electric cars they can be quite

crashy they can be quite uncomfortable

due to the extra weight those dampers

are really really clever and it's so

much more comfortable than i had an i3s

for a year bmw i3s it is a lot more

comfortable than that just to use on a

day-to-day basis you don't really feel

the weight of the car it's very very

well done it's such clever technology i

don't know how they've managed it but it

it does feel like a a smaller more

nimble car and then potentially it

should be so very good news tech wise on

a day-to-day basis i'm a bit of an apple

carplay fiend i love a bit of apple

carplay you can't get that in this car

being google based um you have to rely

on google maps luckily google maps works

very well um so it's not the end of the

world you're not stuck with some awful

system which you've never seen before

it is all very good news so and you can

actually sign in via your google account

you've got the google play store on

there as well so anyone familiar with

android and that kind of operating

system jumping on one of these cars

you're effectively just sitting in a big

phone it's really really good the other

clever thing you can do as well and

let's hope it works right now is you can

talk to it a bit like siri but uh

actually probably slightly better so you

can you can ask all sorts of things

hey google

[Music]

is tge tv a good youtube channel

sorry i don't understand

all right

hey google

what's the weather like today

right now in london it's three degrees

and sunny today it will be mostly sunny

with a forecast high of six and a low of

zero

looks correct to be honest i can't argue

with that it is very cold and it's sunny

so well done one out of two that's not

bad so my previous daily my previous

like city daily was an i3s and the range

on that wasn't brilliant the range on

this Polestar say is around

280 odd miles that is in optimal

conditions however when you've got

freezing cold weather you're using seat

heating you're using the wonderful

heated steering wheel you've got your

music on full blast all the usual

nonsense that does come down

considerably i would say

real world range with a full battery

it's probably closer to 200 miles if

you're faffing around with everything

and you're in winter which is actually

not bad at all and more than enough

charging wise speeds are up to 150

kilowatts so you haven't got tesla

supercharger levels of charging but

earlier i put about 30 of battery in

this thing in about 15 minutes it cost

me about seven pounds eight pounds and i

can live with that it's not bad at all

that is on the expensive side of

charging i use a charging station um

that um that rips me off usual kind of

charging and range gripes

none really to be had with this car and

actually on a day-to-day basis i do

enjoy driving it also actually with

google you can just say hey google

find me a charging station okay i can

play that on youtube music spotify apple

music or deezer

which one do you want to use

none of those are gonna help me charge

my car what are you all about

i'm setting your destination to charge

your car charging station

and being rude worked that's a good

message to put out there actually when

you get low it will ask you do you want

to find a charging station it will give

you a whole load of charging stations

over on the screen at the moment it's

found some nonsense charging station

just parked dundee in scotland showing

results for actually actually when you

get low i ask you do you want to find a

charging station it'll give you a whole

load of charging stations over on the

screen and the moment is found some

nonsense charging station

google are you okay i think i've killed

it

so in all seriousness then when you

actually ask google properly and you

don't mumble or set like an idiot and it

doesn't understand what you're talking

about

it will give you

so many different options it will give

you purely just charging stations it

will give you charging stations with

food it will give you

a live update of how much battery you'll

actually have when you get there how

long it will take you to get there it's

really really smart other points to note

then pottering around it's very very

quiet in here the one thing about

electric cars that car manufacturers

can't get away with is poor build

quality because you hear it you just

can't get away with it and in this there

are no rattles there's no squeaks

there's literally nothing you can't hear

anything going on in here road noise is

actually really good as well you don't

really hear much despite the fact the

tires are absolutely enormous but it's

quiet it's a good place to be on

motorways it's very good news the cruise

control works very well

i don't have anything negative to say

about the car other than the fact i like

car play but i've got over that

pricing then on the Polestar 2. prices

start at 39 000 and something and once

you start ramming a load of options on

it like this car this is about as fully

loaded as it gets that quickly bumps up

to a round i think on the road this car

was about

55

grand which isn't a huge amount of money

particularly when you take into account

the financial incentives for electric

vehicles and the tax efficiencies and

all the kind of mumbo jumbo that you can

get with electric cars these days that

is not a bad place to be particularly

when you're taking into account that

that is literally the most expensive

poster too you can get i think it's good

news

we're at a shell and this is actually

where i usually charge

this polestar not this one but in a

different one so let's see

if it's even working no i don't want to

use an app go away now i just want to

pound a card please

three hours later so as with all

charging stations pretty much you've got

the choice between a ccs plug and what

they call here a chademo plug but ccs is

what we're after here so firm yep give

me it thank you and no fancy flap here

literally in the same position

as a fuel cap would be

indigo this is all looking quite

promising ladies and gentlemen on that

note then whilst we're getting some

juice in the car thank you very much for

watching that is my real world owners

review of my very own

filthy

Polestar 2. it's a big thumbs up overall

for this car actually i just want to

show you the boot space before we go and

expose how

unpleasant i actually live my life

in fairness some of this litter we

actually cleared out for the for the the

review earlier so don't judge me on that

i'm not actually living in the boot but

i could probably

live

in here if

i needed to

thank you very much for watching

do subscribe to electro heads and i'll

see you all very soon

[Music]

you
