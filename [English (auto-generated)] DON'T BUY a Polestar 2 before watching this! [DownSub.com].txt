are you looking to buy a Polestar 2

well if you are you may want to watch

this video

till the very end because in this video

i'm going to go through the things

i find important to know before

purchasing a Polestar 2. i'm going to go

through

as many things in detail which i find

important to know before

purchasing a car like this and i'm also

going to do some comparisons

to the tesla model 3 long range the

brand new 2021 model

which i had two weeks prior to this car

so everything is very fresh

in my mind and at the end of the video

i'm gonna tell you guys

which one of those two cars i would buy

[Music]

there are a few things in this interior

that is lifted right out of the volvo

xc40 which this car shares a platform

with

first off we have the steering wheel

here which is basically identical to

what you find in an xc40 except you have

the poster logo

these buttons are glossy black plastic

instead of matte black plastic and then

you have the stock switch gear behind

the steering wheel

which are lifted out of the xc40 and

then you have the buttons down here and

then lastly you have

the grab handle but everything else here

is bespoke so you have this unique

touchscreen infotainment system here

which you don't find in

any volvo and then you have the overall

design which

feels very familiar but still is

unique to this vehicle and it does feel

different

from a volvo i really do like the design

language here

and what they have you know taken from

volvo like the steering wheel is of high

quality so you have metal finishing here

which feels very nice in the hands you

also have the buttons which do feel high

quality

and then you have the stalks behind the

steering wheel which are the best

functionality of any stocks of any car

in the business i

love volvo stocks and you know

the quality of the interior the

materials are

you know not the top

level of what you would find in

something like a volvo xc90

they are good enough i mean i have

nothing to fault about

the materials i wish maybe some of the

materials would have been a bit

nicer but it's the way they have blended

the different types of materials

and fabrics and layers in this interior

that makes it

interesting and unique so it's not only

one type of material where they have

used the same type of material

everywhere

so up here you have this soft touch

plastic here you have this

fabric type of finish and then you have

this wood inlay here

and then you have like a fabric pattern

finish

here and then also on the top of the

doors this feels like a fabric finish so

it's

the layers of the materials which are

very nice

i'm going to touch upon more about the

infotainment system later in

this video because that is a whole

segment but everything else here is

unique you know it has center console

here you won't find in any other volvo

and also this gear selector here

is very cool with the poster logo here

and well it's open you can put your

fingers through it if you want to do

that but yeah

i really do like this interior guys

actually

yes the exterior does look very

volvo-esque i do

agree with that but that is no wonder

because this car was designed by the

same guy who has designed

every other modern volvo by thomas

engelat

the ceo of this company was the chief

designer at volvo from 2012

till 2017. so he is basically

responsible for every modern

volvo and this was actually shown as a

volvo concept

just a few years ago alongside the xc40

so this was probably meant to be

something like a volvo

s40 at one point in time but when thomas

went to polestar and became the ceo

there

he brought this design over and i must

say

this is one of the most handsome and

best looking cars

in modern history in my opinion i am a

huge fan

of the clean lines the three box shape

and just the classic proportions of this

car it does have things that make it

unique to something like evolvo like you

know

the grill here which is the Polestar

grill it has just enough

personality to make it a little

different

than every other volvo yes you still

have the thorshammer led lights

maybe the best headlight design on the

market

and then you have these cool frameless

mirrors that are actually patented

by poster so instead of the glass moving

within

the housing the whole housing moves

which is very

very cool and then you have the unique

tail lights which you have this

wraparound bar

on the back side of the car so overall

i am a huge fan of the design of this

car i think it is

stunning and to me it doesn't matter

that it looks

a lot like a modern volvo it still has

you know its edge

its own personality but i have owned two

volvo xc90s designed by thomas england

in the past five years so

i love the way this looks

this car's absolutely biggest strength

is

the way it drives so it feels sporty it

feels light

it feels small and nimble very positive

it's quick zero to 100 kilometers an

hour and 4.7 seconds

all those good stuff is very similar to

drive

to a tesla model 3 when it comes to the

sportiness

but when it comes to comfort this is on

a completely different level to a model

3 i mean

i don't know how they have done it i

don't know how they have been able to

make a car that feels sporty engaging

and direct but at the same time it has

comfort levels

close to something like my audi e-tron

in that regard it feels

very similar it feels solid as a tank it

has a

you know a sense of solidity that you

seldom find in anything else

than a german car that is super

impressive

and it irons out about nine tenths of

the bumps you would feel in the model 3

where the multi would be

bouncy short suspension travel it will

just become uncomfortable and very

tiresome this has none of that

and then you have the noise levels or

rather

the lack of noise levels the quietness

of this cabin you know the lack of road

noise

and wind noise compared to the model 3

is amazing i mean

this is so serene and comfortable to

drive compared to that car i mean there

really is a huge difference and if you

don't believe me guys go out and test

drive this car compared to a model 3

because it really is

much more quiet and much more

comfortable

than a model 3.

tech in the Polestar 2 is extremely

good so first off you have self-driving

assistance systems

like pilot assist which is a very

competent system

a system i am very familiar with a

system i trust

a lot i have used it in all the volvos i

have owned and in this car it functions

very similar it may not be as fully

fledged or fully functional

like full self driving from tesla and we

don't even get all

the functions you get over in the us and

within you know our regulations i think

this actually works

better and is a little less annoying it

beeps less

and it's just more comfortable to use

but the real trick up the sleeve of this

car is

the infotainment system so let's turn

around the camera here and show you guys

the digital gauge cluster so this car

alongside the xc40

is one of two cars in the whole world

that has the android automotive

infotainment system giving you

google maps in the central display you

do have different views here

different functionality you know

different information

but getting google maps in the digital

gauge cluster in full screen like this

is amazing this digital gauge cluster is

12.3 inches high contrast high quality

a very nice screen but the best screen

is the central display here at 11 inches

vertically this is a very nice screen to

use

and it might be smaller at 11 inches

than something like in a tesla model 3

which may for a lot of people be

very overwhelming it sits a lit a little

more back

into the dashboard than something like

on the model 3 and is smaller

but what i like about this is that you

can have some information

up here in front of the driver speed

maps you know state of charge all that

good information your

indicators and then you can have the

maps here or you can have your stereo

whatever you want you can split it in

between

those two screens so in my opinion i do

prefer this

to something like the solo and only

screen in the tesla model 3

and then you have the real party trick

which is google assistant so

i'm going to demonstrate this guy so if

you want to mute your

you know uh devices at home that uses

this i'm going to

you know say the prompt so three two

one mute your systems hey google

navigate

hey google how many people live in

norway

[Music]

hey google

so this is so awesome i like this a lot

it's so

easy to use and when i'm in a rush

jumping

to the car i want to go somewhere

instead of you know fiddling about you

know

putting the destination into the

navigation system manually i can just go

hey google navigate

navigate

and it will just do it so effortlessly

so easily

and you can see here also this

infotainment system like a

tesla will show you that you will arrive

there with no state to charge left and

then you can you know add

um a waypoint somewhere to charge so if

i want to

choose this and this so it says two

because well we don't have enough juice

to go there in one go because

we are at 56 percent state of charge it

will

put the charging stations into the

navigation system show you how much

juice you will arrive with at your

destination just like in a tesla so in

many uh regards this is very similar to

the infotainment system in a tesla

done a bit different and you know that

is one of the best infotainment systems

out there

and this being so similar and even

having more custom

you know adjustability and you can

customize it more

you can choose between which screens you

want to use

i find this system better and guys i do

have a whole tour of this infotainment

system where i go in detail

link in the description box down below

the postar 2 comes with basically

almost everything as standard it is

extremely well equipped

you get the glass sunroof you get the

power seats harman kardon sound system

360 camera all the driving aids and all

the tech ass standard but what i would

option

to is this white paint color i would

also option the 20

inch diamond cut wheels and i would go

for the light colored

leather interior with the light colored

wood and

the ventilated seats that would make my

Polestar 2 complete

and that is basically fully specked i

would expect also the

20 inch winter wheels because i live in

norway but then you have basically

a fully and perfect spec Polestar 2 for

551 000 kroners

the short answer is yes and yes

but let me go more into detail and break

it down for you guys because i've done

extensive testing on the 2021 model 3

long range with heat pump

and on this car link to all the videos

in the description box down below if you

want to see

those videos more in detail but what i

have found out is that this car is about

20 to 40 percent more thirsty depending

on speed

and conditions to the model 3 under

similar conditions and on the same

route i've also found out that this car

can go

20 percent less distance than the model

3 long range so the

military long range can go 20 longer but

this car

doesn't have the latest software update

yet which improves efficiency and range

we don't know by how much because poster

haven't said it

and poster even said that this car had

the update but it doesn't have the

update i have confirmed that

it doesn't have the update so that is a

bit annoying

and this car also doesn't have a heat

pump

we know that the xc40 can be optioned

with the heat pump

and poster have told me that a heat pump

will be available at a later time in

this car

and from the test i have seen with the

model 3 heat pump versus non-heat pump

in the cold cars with heat pump are

about 10

more efficient so if this car has the

same efficiency bump as the model 3

when equipped with a heat pump the real

difference

in you know efficiency well is still

going to be like

10 to 30 percent still not you know

there at the model 3 which is basically

the most efficient ev out there

so getting that close is quite

impressive but considering that a model

3 can go 20

longer if this gets that 10 increase

in you know um efficiency

the gap may only be as small as 10

well if the efficiency gains are as big

so that is very interesting but we will

have to see

later in the year you know how big

the efficiency bump really is

something i was very critical about last

year when i tested this postar 2

was the charging speed or rather the

lack of charging speed and it not being

able to come

close to the claim charging speed of 150

kilowatts

those things are still true and i

basically told you guys to go out and

buy a tesla mod 3 because it charges

much quicker

but when it comes to the 21 model model

3 long range with the lg battery pack

that isn't true anymore and that car

only charges about

15 percent quicker on average from 10 to

80

state of charge than this car so the

difference

isn't as huge as it once was and

considering

this car compared to other cars in its

class and at the price range

the charging speed of this isn't too bad

it's actually quite good considering

other cars to choose from so that is

very interesting and what is interesting

is that the chief of technology at volvo

has said in a podcast back in december

is that the xc40p8 recharge

will come with preheating they are

working on it

and it will be similar to something you

will find in a tesla where you put a

charger into the destination

and it will pre-heat the battery

automatically

so when that comes it will be very

interesting to see

the difference in charging speed but we

all know that

tesla usually bump up the charging speed

after a while after you know

the cars have been on the market for a

while and they find it safe so

the discrepancy might be bigger still

when we get pre-heating in this car but

poster may even also you know bump up

the speed

we don't know but as it sits now the

difference in charging between

this and a 21 model long range isn't too

much

as nice as this interior is the front

cabin is

still unnecessarily cramped

especially compared to the xc40 which

this car is closely related to

that car feels airy spacious has a low

center console

and nice amounts of storage first off

you have this huge

center tunnel which serves no purpose at

all other than being huge

in your face and making the front cabin

feel smaller than it actually

is and then you have the lack of storage

so first off you have some compartment

here

with a wireless charging pad which just

doesn't actually charge your phone

so it's completely useless and your

phone's angled away from you so if you

get a notification you have to

go forward with your head like that

that's safe

and then you have this center armrest

here which you can't actually use if you

want to use the cup holder

then you can close it and then you have

a pathetic storage bin here

below the armrest and but if you put

something to drink there you can

actually close it

so the lack of storage and functionality

of this front cabin

is almost almost a deal breaker

last fall when i reviewed the postar 2 i

made a big deal about the

seating position and me getting lower

back pain from it

it not being comfortable and it

basically being a deal breaker for me

thankfully i have been able to find a

more comfortable seating position but

still

the seating position and the

adjustability isn't

optimal let me show you what i mean so

i'm now set at

the distance which is comfortable for my

feet so the dead pedal

is nicely placed there you can see that

i have a nice angle here i don't have

any air

below my thigh and then i have this seat

put in the angle which i find

comfortable so i'm not you know set up

into the dashboard i have enough air you

know the

mirror is at a nice distance but the

problem is is that when

you can see that the steering wheel is

too far away from me right

you should have the steering wheel here

to have a nice comfortable seating

position and a safe seating position

so the way to combat that you could do

one thing and first off i'm going to

show you that there is

a lot of reach but not enough

rake in the xc40 because you see it a

bit higher you can sit closer

and the dead pedal isn't too close the

problem is the dead pedal being too

close

and the way the model 3 fixes this is

that you have

more rake in the steering wheel that

would fix everything

but you could do a few things you could

put the seat back up but then

you know the mirror is a bit close and

i'm sitting too upright i don't want to

do that

if i put the seat forwards more

i get this angle and this is fine you

know for short

driving periods but after a few hours on

the road

not having the support puts the strain

on my lower back it might just be my

body

guys but i want to explain this in

detail to you so the way i combat this

is by putting up

the seat cushion at an angle like this

and then i can move

forward so this is the way and then i

have this angle i still am a bit too

close to the mirror but i'm sitting

at a much better angle so i have had

this seating position for the past

three days driven this car more than 1

000 kilometers and

it works still not optimal

i'm gonna put it back a bit still not

optimal but

i don't get any lower back pain so this

is something i could live with

on its own mirrors alone the Polestar 2 is

an awesome car it's a great car

it looks good it drives good it's

comfortable it's fast

it's sporty it has a nice interior

it does a lot of things very well

but we don't live in a vacuum and we

have to compare to its main competitor

the tesla model 3 and on paper

it looks like it's not a competition the

model 3 is cheaper

charges faster goes the furthest has

you know arguably a more practical cabin

with more

space in the front cabin this may be you

know a bit more practical being a hatch

but i don't live on paper and you people

probably don't live on paper either

because in my opinion the way this thing

drives

the way it rides the way it

is quiet on the motorway how serene it

is

can't be measured you know in zero to

100 kilometer

an hour times it can't be measured in

over-the-air updates it can't be

measured in

the number of superchargers to me

the comfort levels the lack of

noise the refinement levels the nvh

levels

over weighs the

lack of range the lack of charging speed

because it charges fast enough

for most people it also goes

far enough for most people to me

this is a better car for what i care

about

i think it rides great it drives great

it handles great

it's so comfortable to live with

and it's beautiful it is one of the best

looking cars

in modern history in my opinion

so guys i'm very fond of this car

and i'm so fond of it that you know

i'm maybe considering getting one but i

have my e-tron so

maybe not now but guys if i hit 100 000

subscribers i may buy one so

you guys know what to do if you want me

to get one

so guys i hope you enjoyed today's video

if you did please drop me a thumbs up

down below and for more car content as

always guys

please subscribe see you guys later and

[Music]

goodbye

[Music]

you
