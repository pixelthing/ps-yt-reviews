the electric vehicle market is evolving

and we hear out of fuel right here for

you to cover it with the all-new pole

star to finally a serious competitor to

the Tesla Model 3 or also to BMW

3-series of the a4 Mercedes c-class

we'll find out more here on exterior

interior and driving experience with

this Polestar to tune in here in full

HD full screen and full length let's go

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

in the front yeah you can see sporty

stands on the road by the Polestar to

the false Hema LED lamp see with the

daytime running light this is done Volvo

heritage inspired and it starts with LED

headlamps and if you'll get the so

called plus package in certain markets

already included now then you also get

the pixel LEDs so for a more extensive

elaborated led function then you can see

it does have somewhat of a crossover

look here in the front and it will also

continue over on to the side profile we

see more about that soon then it has so

to say a typical sedan look also in the

front but of course he a little bit more

closed because of the electric wheel

does need doesn't need so much cooling

but they don't fall a concept saying

like screaming out hey I'm an electric

vehicle it's more an ordinary look then

again with some accent what do you think

about the first impression 4 meter 60 15

foot 1 or 181 inches is the length of

the Polestar 2 and taking the Tesla

Model 3 but also the internal combustion

competitors here in this midsize sedan

segment you can see the shape is indeed

typical mid-size sedan with a beautiful

roof line right there strong shoulders

actually a little bit sports car like

then you have the contrasting bumper so

more you know somewhat of a crossover

style as well then we can see it was

also interesting the side mirrors here

they are frameless almost frameless one

of the first times we see that I think

it's a very beautiful integration and

can see here very flat roof line also

not so high with the windows right there

as for technologies you start standard

with the adaptive suspension and 19-inch

wheels and then there are also 20-inch

wheels optionally available this here is

a car with a performance pack the

performance pack includes 20-inch wheels

they are also the forged 20-inch wheels

then bigger Brembo brake discs also with

golden brake calipers you'll also have

golden seatbelts on the inside soon more

about that you have a black panoramic

roof in this performance

and then also the dam has changed

performance pack comes with Uhlans

dampers they are fixed you can adjust

them hardware wise from the outside but

then that's basically it never have to

go to the to the workshop again so

adapter suspension if you want more

comfort and 19-inch wheels that would be

the most comfortable set up the form

spec 20 inch wheels with the fixed

Berlin standards will give you more

stiffness if you want a sport you're

right of course

super motor that when driving in the

rear you can also see a very sleek

design you realize that the Polestar CEO

thomas in a nod is a designer at heart

then you can see here light strip goes

all over the vehicle right there and

then forming this C on both sides pole

star logo and then this contrast between

the V color and the black lower part of

course here even more contrast dish

because it's a wide vehicle and let me

already give you the performance figures

is four hundred eight horsepower 660

Newton meters of torque overdrive

because two electric motors one in the

front one in the rear here they're both

actually the same and the overdrive

distribution is always about 50/50 so it

doesn't really change and 4.7 seconds is

the acceleration figure zero to 100

kilometers or zero to sixty months now

about charging and battery so it is on

the driver side 11 kilo watt AC charging

up to 150 kilowatt DC charging of that

78 kilowatt hour battery

gross or 72.5 kilowatt net and that will

give us a range officially fall out 70

kilometers into a 90 miles but if we're

a little bit more realistic and

depending on situation for 40 kilometers

or to 170 miles that's you know what you

can always count

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

this is the khaki this is a small

downside this is you know really cheap

and plastic ish the only good thing is

that they don't use a leather wrap but I

think a leather wrap for example would

be a suitable solution for that opening

closing I'll let you rather use the keys

entry put your hand on the outside to

close it and on the oh they look at that

how oh this the side mirror here open it

again it's just slightly obviously

doesn't go all the way in hmm

interesting

but then again here with the almost

frameless what a beautiful design of

this side mirror yeah just just stick

and you know when I when I close it I

would expect it to fold in a little bit

closer to the vehicle hmm interesting

there we go yeah you know we like to

take a look at details so then instead

of the vehicle here there's a soft touch

material top part and it's some kind of

fabric it's you know it's looking slick

but it's rather rough surface from what

you feel but although I think a good

choice then the soft material here and

here as well then the Scandinavian

bright fabric design really cool memory

seating the door pockets are rather slim

then first look at the interior the

steering wheel is similar to the one we

see in the recent Volvo's for example

then - Sport material is not exactly

hard packs a little bit soft and again

this fabric surface everything looks and

feels really good the floor mats by the

way I like them because they're so easy

to pop in and out here so they're really

secure and safe but then it's so easy to

put in and out that you can actually

clean them or just you know shake them a

little bit around on the outside so to

me those things you know are really

interesting then the seats one of the

key features here this car is really

vegan from the interior so animal

framing Hewitt's both on the steering

wheel and on the seats here either with

this

design or you can also get a blue-ish

design actually they still unlike Tesla

offer animal skin option but that's of

course not really necessary and also

doesn't make sense because these seats

here interesting the outside fabric is

little bit you know rough on more open

cell I would say from the material the

inside looks slick it looks like a

leather Rhett but it also has some kind

of a structure to be more breathable

actually and so the big advantage then

also just practical wise yes these seats

will stay cool and summer and warm and

winter

unlike the animal skin option which you

should not go for for ethical reasons

environmental reasons and of course

awesome just for practical reasons so

very good job upholster to introduce

that the performance pack here

introduces also these gold and seatbelts

and like that so it's a nice contrast to

that getting inside is like typically

with the midsize sedan and you find a

good seating position the seats are also

quite comfortable from the first

impression through motor driving the

lower part you can put out and this

favorite material is really something

very new it's very interesting it

doesn't feel I mean this is like a

typical ferric material finding cars

we're just totally good but this one

here indeed new and I think they really

wanted to do that to combine somehow in

our functionality and the design looks

so a very interesting approach and we

would really like to see more of that

that shows that it's really possible to

combine sustainability and premium this

is what this guy is actually all about

then putting this steering wheel in and

out and up and down to find your

position I'm 1-86 or 6.1 you know that

was from an institutional at Thomas

let's go and hear Headroom is pretty

close to the outside a little bit

further into the inside this one here

equipped with the panoramic roof which

is fixed it cannot be opened the only

thing is you know you have this Yui

layering that is also reducing the

heating up of the cabin we have to see

how it is when you really like you know

have 40 degrees cells on the outside or

you are in in the 90s in

Fahrenheit we have to see about that but

for normal climate you know it will

actually be quite ok so in soon more

details to all of the screens first of

all clean interior experience and what

you noticing when in 2003 you know I

really like the Tesla technology

approach and also their sustainability

and you know change of mobility approach

one thing you feel here they have the

Volvo experience so to say so the

finishing of the materials for the you

know first glance this is where this one

would be better than the model 3

interior overview first as general

overview general overview then here the

steering wheel again vulva inspired I

think they could do something more in

the future there to differentiate it

from the Volvo models rides adhere to

control something of the instruments on

the left or here the volume up and down

voice input you can also activate here

or just with the speech input soon more

to that left side then for the cruise

control functions on the middle part

here you have the vertical screen so

it's about 11 inches and the left

digital instrument is twelve point three

inches and the over design is very clean

optional Harmon consultant or include in

the Plus package which is in some

markets now also included really depends

on market specifications then here again

softer dashboard and the nice fabric

here with a rather rough surface a very

interesting one then the met would

experience here and also at the inside

there so a beautiful interior design

this inductive charging pad for your

smartphone but you also have to use BC

charges right there in the front then we

have this crystal look volume knob thank

you so much that we still have a manual

volume knob that's really cool under

play on stop button and we can also test

you know the Harman Kardon sound system

he was a song by above and beyond

well it was a very cool surround sound I

like that

beautiful so yeah good when the plus

package is already included then when

you buy the car should really go for

this it's a sound system really nice

then this shifting lever here is a

beautiful job also with the illuminated

Polestar logo in the center part put it

in the front for reverse gear and back

then for the D mode and when you're in

the reverse key you can also see the

camera system is being activated that

gives you this 360-degree view but you

can also just activate for example just

the rear camera it's also a decent

solution consumer deals to the screens

then we have couples here their adaptive

one center one here and there's this

armrest you can put up and then there's

another cup holder below that and it's

also adaptive I think a good solution

well guys brace yourself because so far

these infotainment screens by the

entertainment software by the

manufacturers they were evolving

evolving but they were always not

keeping up to our smartphones

oh they're smoothly my little sweetie

yeah about that and now it has changed

this system here is Android based and so

it's super fast

it's just what we need and I'll explain

you all why first of all this is the car

menu here right there in the top part so

coming in there you can change the

creeping mode so when you lift the brake

that the car either just stand still or

creeps a little bit forward depending on

how you like it better spot normally is

to reduce stability control the steering

feel lights and the firming will test

while driving and the one pedal drive

how harsh you want to have the

acceleration here I would leave it in

standard mode for safety reasons also I

will explain that why in the driving

assistance systems you can also activate

or deactivate and everything has a clear

overview actually you see the better

it's not quite full yet but definitely

enough and here look at that how easy

everything is I mean it is so intuitive

even if you have never seen the system

yet and the camera system me again you

can read it right there and this then is

this app view for the

you know for the Android system you can

use the Play Store and install new apps

this is something that we will be now

build more and more that you can install

more and more apps well here the

temperature is in the screen and to

reach that while driving this is maybe

the only floor I like to have separate

climate knobs but the design of the car

hardly makes it possible seat heating

here and also heated steering wheel but

the voice assistant is so sophisticated

that in this case it's easy actually

there will be a perk a play available by

the way later on and 2021

and when outs were actually not the

reason is you don't need it because this

is an Android system already and can do

everything with it you would connect

your phone where bluetooth for the

contacts and so on and here you're just

and say yeah use the Google assistant

Google Maps of course

look at how responsive that is and we

all know Google Maps is the best sat-nav

and it really you know includes all the

live data and you can just you know get

to the destination very quickly hey

Google Drive me to Berlin I mean that's

totally flawless and also you know how

quickly everything was realized from the

voice input and I mean it goes even

further hey Google

change temperature to 20 degrees I'm

didn't know why I was calculating also

here this map you see there was a little

bit little bit delay but just a little

bit otherwise it would have you know

would it be even faster hey Google Play

something from Armin van Buuren

I mean guys this is so awesome I mean

I've never seen a system that is working

better I mean the voice input by Tesla

is of course really cool that's that's

true yes but this one is mine I mean

it's it's beyond anything else you know

you see I'm a Peru this is really like

this is finally how everything should be

so I can just say that'll sums up 12.3

digital instruments 12:1 three-inch you

can see he is like a star of view and

then when you hit the brakes and put in

the D motor drive mode switches do this

you know active display and there we go

and for example you can also have the

GPS map then all the way all over the

screen it's clear it's simple it's just

how it should be real yeah inside the

doors also with the soft touch fabric

then again the bright Scandinavian

furniture design right there and also

the same seat design in the rear with

the nice contrasting seat belt as well

hey we had three contrasting sympathy in

the rear way to go and in the middle

climate unit you also have seen heating

for the area outside seats and also

behind this cover there two more USB sea

chargers so you know it's not like a

typical Evie only platform so let's see

about the result there and like one bars

there's actually no problem so again

with one is it six or six foot one

enough like Rob left when the seat is in

the lowest position I can hardly put my

feet under it so when you have you know

big feet like I do and you should raise

the driver seat a little bit a hello

driver could you put the seat a little

bit higher thank you and then you can

even you know better fit with your with

your feet here maybe that's one design

flaw the seat should have been flatter

from the lower part had mumbai's exactly

fits for me so my hands do touch the

steering when I put up my spine so I

think it

it's still okay so with four tall adults

is actually no problem interesting that

with this you know fixed panoramic roof

here I do already fear this UV

protection because sometimes when you're

on you know sitting in cars and that the

pin around group and the Sun is really

shining and it's like well you

immediately feel how hot it is but here

you know the Sun is you know just like

half behind that tree now even if you

know tend to look towards the Sun which

of course you should never do then you

don't feel it would be so hot so very

interesting first impression as well

that and that from here I can also see

this projected polls that logo there in

the panoramic roof there's also very

interesting detail yeah I think it's

really comfortable you in the rear

I also fix it the outside parts you do

there it is you know for the child seats

then you do flip the seats from here

because you cannot do it from a trial so

I'm showing you the trunk of course in

the middle part you can also put this

middle head restraint up is good for

safety and here adaptive cupholders this

will also feature ski hatch by the way

in the middle seat well there's this

tunnel for the torsional rigidity you do

not need it because there's no

mechanical link actually this it and

just follow you know the stability

reasons and of course they need to put

batteries somewhere that place to play

low in the vehicle to keep the center of

gravity low you can also sit in the

middle seats not the most comfortable

position but also with five tour adults

this guy is very well usable well in

past days it was only the Porsche 911 or

with the VW Beetle

yeah but electric vehicles really

revived the name front trunk Frank and

let's take a look at the Frank right

here and even is and they can store your

charging cables different charging

cables for like you know charging

station and at home and so on and then

all the rear stays clean so I think yeah

good solution also you know this soft

cover here in the front and the only

other thing here for the wiper fluid you

can refill it right here 405 to 1095

liters is the boot capacity with

see it's here the button below clean

design integration but that might catch

a lot of dirt and while driving that's

the downside of it but you can also open

it with the key fob for example this is

really cool fast bag opening big

difference with the Tesla Model 3 which

has this typical sit-down opening this

is very easy to load things in and out

if you don't want to open that wide you

can also for example stop it in this

position and hold in this position and

the opening button after you know

beeping sound occurs next time it will

also stop in this position this top

camera here you can remove if you like

we can't flip the seats or fold the

seats from here you could reach over as

soon do that

what is interesting that we have a trunk

split right here this is really cool I

mean owner from Volvo models as well to

secure for example you just want to put

the backpack in here and you don't want

it to fly all over the place or just to

split it here for cabin trolley

this I think is a great easy solution

like this you know and then it can Tino

slide all over the trunk you can see it

also fits in here in the vertical way no

problem actually and then below that you

could then again also store your

charging cables this is the body cover

here for shows for example but um you

know there's me home to the guide or as

a customer nun this is actually good

space also for the charging cables

because the rear trunk is always better

to open so you can you know very that on

the left side you have a 12-volt power

supply and also the retractable towing

hook so if I press this button here at

the lower side of the vehicle there will

be the towing hug coming up there we go

tada there we have a so electric vehicle

also with towing capacity and you can

also put it back in here again

then what about some measurements

lengthier normal length is about a meter

the width is also about the meter and

the height here to the top cover is

about 40 centimeters pretty much senate

size as you can see you can use a ski

hedge to load things

in the middle part you can also then

fold the seats right here like this 2/3

1/3 split and the maximum length then to

the front seats as we would be driving

so that's about 1 meters and 80 last but

not least what about the child safety

test of this hatch let's check it out

[Music]

that's okay

welcome to Thomas is driving loud with

the Polestar too we go through different

driving situations city motorway

suspension overview and so on one pedal

driving so everything you need to know

so at the moment I got everything in the

standard mode so this is then harsh

recuperation strong recuperation so when

I lift the throttle really you know

recuperates very well so you actually

don't need the brake pedal in most

situations you just have this one pedal

driving feeling and that's actually cool

and I think it's also a safety thing

because when you just use one pedal and

you lift your foot off the throttle then

you immediately break and in the time

you would need to switch from the

expiration panel to the brake pedal

there is you know a second that calls

your time in deceleration so I think

that's definitely a safety thing to

leave it like this you can also put it

too low for examples so you know let's

say you you don't want to use this in

that way then the recuperation is a

little bit less actually and you could

also put two absolutely off so here now

low you see the car rolled a little bit

further actually and then that's it or

often if you just want the roll and of

course when you use the brakes you still

do we generate energy it's just that you

know it's a different setting here

creeper by the way when I set the creep

mode to on then I know it's like uphill

but then the car creeps a little bit

forward when you stand still like this

no no it works

yeah creeping little bit forward that's

more like in normal automatic gearbox

for example I like this feature actually

also for traffic for example then you

roll little bit forward just by

releasing the brakes

I would leave it like this steering

feeling here there's a standard you can

also pull tool I then it's like hardly

any resistance but you also don't have a

feel it

and then when you put it to firm then

you have a little bit more fee pics also

according to your liking if you're

driving with the passenger or peasant

dress especially in the rear by the way

and you have the one peddle drive

feeding it to standard be aware that

when you suddenly lift the throttle

totally there's really a lot of g-forces

applied so you would need to learn the

evie driving mode with one pedal driving

to be smooth all through the throttle so

if you want to for example there's a

next traffic light and then you slightly

go off the floor and really finely tuned

it that's also a good experience for

your passengers that's something you

know you just get used it and it happens

quite quickly and also you know in a

very intuitive way of course the torque

of this engine 6 or 60 Newton meters of

torque I mean it's already they are

always really need it

there's no classic power curve of an

internal combustion engine and no when

we get onto little bit more speed soon

but over here turning indicator sound is

really unique it's like a very special

sound so have never heard such a turning

indicator sound you have to get used to

it

but I think it it sounds kind of premium

and different I mean so yeah why not so

I think before we do the first

acceleration thing Jones you have

something on the dashboard there maybe

that will fly all over the place when I

have to acceleration yeah there it is so

because you always have to bear in mind

here just 40 to 60 you ready that's it

like pop and we're there and yeah we

know you know test our model 3 for

example in the performance world has

even more punch but this year no

acceleration was definite in regions of

like an

being double threes use em performance

model Audi s4 Mercedes C 43 and so on so

you give more than enough power and most

of the times you have to say like well

you know let's let's really finely tune

it not to accelerate it and this is

really cool you know you have a very

sustainable vehicle of course it will

always be more sustainable to buy a used

car whatever because it's already built

but if you buy a new vehicle this one

will already be a very sustainable one

from the intimate areas and so on and we

know that electric vehicles do have a

better overall co2 output as well

although some bias studies claim

otherwise but at the end of the day they

are actually better especially when they

used an a regenerative energy mix and

you know or they know you can gain back

the energy now when you lift the

throttle and also you know short term is

no problem you can start at any

temperature then it you know make a

little bit cooler you know that the

battery maybe you know changes that air

consumption and but there's no problem

for an electric motor just to do a

start-up and directly hit the throttle

that would be bad for internal

combustion engine then we have the

Rulon's dampers here the optional ones

and 20-inch wheels so the most

uncomfortable setup here you can get for

this vehicle again the most comfortable

be standard adaptive dampers together

with be 19-inch wheels and I would also

advise you to go for that it will be

sporty enough this is still you know

later in the sport away then for example

Volvo s60 would be this one here this

setup here if you really want a sports

car feeling and indeed these only

earnings dampers together with the

20-inch wheel they do deliver a sports

car feeling more again like C 43

like an M 340i and so on and actually

gives me a very good feedback from the

road

the steering feeling is I would rather

probably set it to firm to have some

more feedback because that's maybe the

only thing that the German premium and

effectors can still do better to give

you like a steering feeling that gives

you a better connection between Road car

and the driver it's not bad at all here

and it's also you know precise and

direct enough just like from the natural

connection experience it could use it

could use some some fine tuning for

example yeah if you're just a mere OC

and it goes quite quickly so let's get

on the motorway right here

Blackfoot more at all there's this red

stripe in the mirror and here we can

accelerate from 80 to 120 but that's it

wow that's that's so amazing

really Wow and after Google Maps view

you're awesome in the center part and

it's so flawless to to read and see that

that I actually don't even need the

center DBS there usually with the

digital couple sometimes I also put it

here like two just to compare but here

that's that's all Falls are good now

driving at the one or kilometers now are

and it's also still perfectly silent

here in this interior you can gaining

back some energy now sitting in a cruise

control 280 kilometers an hour and just

relax

so noise insulation wise so far also a

very good experience again to these

dampers can you use them in your

everyday driving life I mean you do feel

the stiffness but it's not that you

would feel like it's like oh if I bought

this or like they say it's a man you'd

buy a used car with 20-inch wheels and

the Olin dampers thing like do I lose

all comforts I think it's still ok so

it's not the harshest setup but

definitely you have to be aware of that

you will have more comfortable everyday

driving up if you just stick with the

normal adaptive suspension so I think

doesn't really make so much sense to get

these option temples unless you really

appreciate that very very sport is set

up and yeah I mean with that set up this

car would actually even be racetrack

suitable and you know we talked about

the Tesla Model 3 when we

on the trek they said it just needs some

optional aliens or beer stein dampers

and then it's a perfect trick vehicle he

can already get it from works you know

so that's definitely very interesting

experience

so let's line up in the traffic right

here again setting the cruise control

you can also set distance to the car in

front of us here again left on the

steering wheel and no then the distance

also is being kept

depending on how you set it by the way

the size of the vehicle here you feel

good also here in construction side

lanes overview is excellent here through

the sides because there's hardly any

frame so a very clear view of what's

here and I don't need virtual mirrors

for that

so the react a little bit limited

because the rear window has some kind of

a notch so to say and it's not very tiny

if you look through the a pillar here is

okay standard the beeper is quite thick

so again the blind spot motor is

something you can definitely use so you

should you know but it's always included

with with the car so that's again

something good alternatives the

emergency brake also include with the

vehicle so I think configurating this

car is also very easy because most of

the things are already inside no I'm

saying reading once again to mark Lum

does everything feels so flawless with

it with his vehicle that's again

something pretty pretty cool

object lanes and you know it you next

yeah I don't need even hit me do a hit

the brakes you know there's like some

police was not using the brakes at all

so there will be just very rare

situations when you leave it in the

Senate every corporation modes where you

really need the brakes on a truck need

to change your tire happens from time to

time so again once you know such a

flawless driving experience with this

vehicle let's now get to a little bit

more speed it's so so cool to accelerate

this car out and everything Sun I don't

miss any engine sound at all it's

absolutely not needed

a little bit higher speed

better or worse as for noise insulation

then they compared us think proximately

at the same level the overall driving

feeling then if you would forget you

know for for thing that you have you

know this electric drive it could at

some point also be a volvo a sixty or

something and again we have that's

different right here so this is thing

about this car it's not you know it's

not not normal so you feel like driving

normal midsize sedan it's not that

spaceship and unique like with it like

like the Tesla Model 3 when you drive

the test of all three it's really like

unlike anything else so this is more

normal car like so to say but then it

adds this this special characteristics

its unique features and I can just say

that everything that that said this

party apart for example from Volvo s60

combustion engine is indeed better

there's better acceleration the car has

a lower center of gravity that makes it

feel very sporty when they're doing in

your lane changes here it really feels

like a you know like a serious sports

car so everything they made evey here

really improved it then you have the

good software what's also interesting by

the way is that you can change the

temperature let's say in a little bit

better way so many freaking loop on

center part then here this is easier to

change temperature while driving for

example we have this bigger display so

yeah that's somewhat ok clicking in

lower part

on the temperature so it's yeah I mean

it's a little bit distressing yes you

can also the to zone AC while we're

right and left so this quite big this

pay for that now more acceleration 102

let's see

Oh

and 180 kilometers an hour you see ya

already when we add speed still a good

excursion but that BMW was also quite

fast and now to 160 kilometres an hour

and still good as well noise situations

really silently you don't remember when

we're in electric vehicles there's no

engine sound that would cover wing noise

and so on therefore this installations

even more important here that was also

perfectly fine you know about 130 125

miles while they have 125 kilometers

Noah yeah that would be a little bit

fast so 130 would be some you know 80

miles typical motorway speed also with a

higher motorway speed and that's once

again totally fine great noise

insulation also higher speeds lucky that

we are under move all the way today and

we can test an even higher speed and Wow

such a fun to accelerate all even at

higher speeds so amazing

with that 180 kilometers an hour and

again it's not exceeding the noisy you

know also really cool and when I lift

the throttle again good recuperation

getting inside here Wow

what a cool experience and yeah and

what's time to take it out of the drum

and vote away that's what we did here

today the only thing that is missing is

a proper consumption test so when you

accelerated out in that way of course

yeah I mean it's it's not that realistic

you don't do that all the time so let me

reset the consumption meter click again

to confirm and let's put it to a cruise

control speed to 100 kilometers an hour

here we go and let's see what the

consumption then says me to the right

line that everyone can drive faster now

so because then when we have the new

calculated energy consumption then we

can then calculate once again with the

battery with the net size of the battery

which would be a more realistic range as

for our test wait just a little bit

drive a little bit further and then

present you the result in the final

conclusion once again driving dynamics

is awesome a little bit more feel in the

steering wheel but then when you sit a

little bit stiffer you in the mode it's

actually quite cool it's a lot of fun to

drive low sinner priorities so enter a

feeling of this vehicle more agile than

any other midsize sedan the feed spot

you also new testamental 3 even though

it doesn't have like them high powerful

form of acceleration but it's more than

enough it has some serious power really

good recreation is good one pedal drive

feeling is good the noise insulation is

well done so there's hardly anything to

complain about

the seats here also gives you a good

long-term support and so on so

this is again just like we've seen

exterior design styling wise interior

and so on such an awesome vehicle can't

say otherwise one more addition here for

longer out of the fuel version the pilot

assists as we know from the Volvo models

is also in here so you activated by one

right click here at the steering wheel

then you have this yellow Stephenville

symbol and then actually recognizes

what's going on and keeps you in the

lane so I'm not stealing yet at the

moment of course not meant to be an

autopilot so you should not take your

hands off the steering wheel but it

works quite well you know we will see

that the lane changed a little bit now

you can see it automatically corrects

just a little bit to the right and now

once again a little bit to the left

so never trusting it a hundred percent

but you see it works actually quite well

and also write quite a few spoilers here

it also needs some no apply steering oh

you see that fizzy also has a capacitive

function than here so it didn't need me

as a steering intervention but just to

put it once again on the steering wheel

we see it doesn't just you know

demonstrating Berbers now please don't

do it at home and here then let's see

oh yeah so you see when when you have

standing objects you should be a little

bit careful these adapters Cruzan holds

I rather set on moving objects so yeah

at some point of course the Altimas

emergency break would have been

activated but of course you can make

more you know a more smooth breaking

experience than when you see stuff like

this in advance again the assistance is

ins are good and helpful but never trust

a hundred percent in them however here

you know how the lanes being kept also

on the motorway we tested oh yeah it's

actually quite good not the most natural

to smoothest with steering program but

definitely not a bad one also it's also

nice to have it to be able to relax them

a little bit more maybe on longer

motorway hauls

and now we're back here with our

conclusion for today with the Polestar

to the white courier by the way is

called

snow so snow white exterior a strong

stance here to be a midsize sedan shape

but with a lot of sporty elements so I

think really likeable interior a clean

design clean layout high build quality

and actually in this case totally

animal-free materials yes they still

offer the option but most people

probably won't go for it and it's also

reason behind it so a very good interior

also have enough space the only two

minor things is when you sit in the rear

you should put the seats in the front a

little bit higher for a better you know

foot position in the rear and also the

co driver seat the passenger seat we

always use ready terms here there are

also when you put your feet in the very

front knee of long legs then there

should also be a little bit more space

for your feet

these are two minor flaws other than

that yeah that could be still climate

knobs we know a lot of us guys really

appreciate it but the voice input is

just super up the whole infotainment

system is the best you can get actually

the Google integration there's nothing

better here at the moment also the GPS

and so on the voice input is just so

fast and so flawless so the thoughts

behind this vehicle are really really

good that we have the fastback opening

in the rear for example as well so this

is the vehicle how the BMW and Mercedes

should brought should have brought out

five years ago this is it this is a very

contemporary vehicle now it serves

almost all needs and it's just an

awesome ride it's very quick very

performant yet at the same time it's

comfortable and the riding experience

the energy consumption here in altes is

about 17 kilowatt hours on in Milan

kilometers that's about 27 kilowatt

hours on 1l miles and how did I do this

calculation I just asked the

infotainment system hey Google 17

kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers in

kilowatt hours per 100 miles and then it

said 27 so and that also confirms our

approximate range figure of about 40

kilometers or two months

and he minds and I think that's also

absolutely sufficient so you need a

charging infrastructure at home or work

that's of course with every electric

vehicle that you know shouldn't rely all

on the you know on the remote charging

stations and the public tracking station

and so on but other than that I think

this is actually the midsize car to go

for the Tesla Model 3 of course to

strong competitors now the Tesla has

some tweaks here and there some very

good things made it a little bit more

efficient here and there for example and

it's a different infotainment system for

example

however the posts are better in the

interior build quality for example the

driving animus is also superb actually

so they're really very close at the

moment probably I would rather tend a

little bit bit towards this one here and

it's krylova clear that when you have

your charging infrastructure cleared

this car here really exceeds the

performance of the internal combustion

engine a internal combustion engine

compared us and that's something really

astonishing so what a surprising

experience here with the Polestar -

really impressed here today what's your

opinion please discuss it in the

comments and also what you think about

the comparison to the competitors will

also link some interesting videos for

you in a video description and also in

the pin comment thank you so much for

tuning in today see you next time
