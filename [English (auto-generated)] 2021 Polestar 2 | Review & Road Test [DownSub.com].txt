later today when my wife asks what do

you mean you spent all day with a pole

star

this is what i'll tell her baby to be

clear

whole star is an electrified offshoot of

volvo and their chinese benefactor geely

the polestar 1 is a super limited

production hybrid

supercar thingy but the Polestar 2

that's a comparatively mainstream 5

passenger pure electric all-wheel drive

raised fastback sedan

thing it can cover more than 200 miles

on a charge though specific epa

estimates weren't available when i made

this video

and it has a base price of fifty nine

thousand nine hundred dollars

plus thirteen hundred dollars in

destination charges though less

expensive renditions are on the horizon

that's actually a pretty solid

encapsulation but trust me there's a lot

more to know

for example the Polestar 2 drives great

driven at a moderate pace the Polestar 2

rides with a comfortable

composed quality by the way the car i'm

driving has the performance package

which has the 22 way adjustable

olens dampers so if you have track day

aspirations that's something you can do

or if you want the smoothest riding

boulevard cruiser electric car

on the planet that's also an option but

that's a manual adjustment so you have

to take about 10 minutes

in order to get to those dampers and

adjust them but yeah i'm enjoying the

ride

despite the pull star 2 sporting

aspirations the steering

leaves me a little cold it doesn't feel

bad it goes where you want to go

but a little bit more communication

would be nice

communication aside you can adjust the

steering feel light

firm i'm a standard guy

electric cars are known for their

instant relentless electric propulsion

let's see what we're working with

yeah that's good

[Music]

according to polestar the two can run

0-60 in about four and a half seconds

are there teslas that can post more

impressive numbers yes

do those numbers matter to me as i punch

it coming out of this

corner no no they do not matter

[Music]

thrust comes from two identical front

and rear electric motors

delivering all-wheel drive traction and

a combined output of 408 horsepower

for slowing down there is a brake pedal

but with max regenerative braking active

you'll rarely need to use it

heads up whether you use the one pedal

drive function or you use the brake

pedal

regenerative braking is active up to 0.3

gs of deceleration after that

the hydraulic brakes come into play mike

let's see what that feels like

regen regen regen hydraulic um

wow during my drive i noticed some odd

brake feel during spirited cornering

with the Polestar 2 benefits from

over-the-air updates

and by the time you watch this video a

break update will have been

implemented one more observation from

the driver's seat over my right shoulder

thick c pillar

left shoulder thick b pillar so outward

visibility is a little bit hindered

in those directions but that probably

means that the roof crush strength is

impeccable not that i plan on testing it

well we'll see how the day goes

and now the most thrilling part of every

mica hosted review the time when i use

my utterly average 5 foot 10 inch body

to show off interior space moving into

the front seat

oh that fits me nicely we got a good

range of movement here

comes back far headspace outstanding

go into the back seat this is the big

test can i

fit behind myself knee clearance

good head space good

a little bit vertical for my taste but

still comfortable because there's a

little bit of support down here in the

bottom

oh and how's the rear arm rest

squishy that's bad that's good

hair barely brushing the top here but

manageable

i dub the functional

beyond dimensions Polestar has crafted

a cabin worthy of its swedish heritage

the germans hold an edge where sumptuous

luxury is concerned but there's a simple

honest effortless grace in here that i

appreciate

before moving on let's see how the

Polestar 2 ranks on the mica muzio elbow

comfort index

outboard nice positioning reasonably

soft i can hold my hand on the steering

wheel and put my elbow down inboard

there's a gap right where my elbow

should go but wait it slides forward

very soft nice positioning that's going

to rank high

i think the squirrel is pleased from a

cargo perspective

the Polestar 2 offers a cozy 1.3 cubic

foot frunk

to supplement the 14.2 cubic foot trunk

oh god that's hard to say

those numbers aren't massive but they

are perfectly workable

moving to infotainment tesla has set the

standard for big old screens and

electric cars

but the two's 11.15 inch screen has

nothing to be ashamed

of built using android automotive os the

system is a finely arranged intuitive

interface

that leverages over-the-air updates

google maps google natural voice

recognition

and the google play app store given how

many times i just said google it's a

pleasant surprise that apple carplay

is available if it's not your car yet

it'll come soon via an over-the-air

update

i'll add that buyers who'd rather not

connect a google account to their car

perhaps for privacy reasons

we'll miss out on the system's full

potential also if you enter a cell

service dark zone

much of that google-based functionality

stops working

further while polestar has crafted a

pleasing interface i still have a warm

place in my heart for tesla synthesizer

video game fart mode goofballery

oh and like tesla the Polestar 2 has no

start button you just get in put it in

drive and you're on your way

as for dynamic tech the Polestar 2 packs

a full complement including adaptive

cruise control

rear collision warning and front

collision avoidance that uses the brakes

and steering

to help you not crash with all that on

the table let's see how well

pilot assist follows that old honda crv

in front of us

steering's working pretty well good

distance

right on pilot assist for charging the

78 kilowatt hour lithium ion battery

pack from empty

a 240 volt charger takes about eight

hours

use a 150 kilowatt dc quick charger

and a zero to eighty percent charge

takes about 40 minutes

while electric car charging options

continue to expand in america

for fast charging on the go tesla's vast

super charging network remains an

enviable resource

swinging back in polestar's favor it's

still eligible for 7 500

in federal tax incentives unlike tesla

plus potential state incentives

that hacks a healthy chunk off the

roughly 60 000 base price

which includes 19 inch wheels led

headlights

front inner side airbags a 360 degree

camera

four usb c ports and a ton of other

niceties

if you want any color besides black

that'll be twelve hundred dollars

an apple leather interior costs four

grand and if you got a spare 5k

the performance pack adds gold brembo

brakes gold seat belts

manually adjustable olens dampers hello

track days

and 20 inch wheels with continental

tires but i'd probably swap for

something grippier

one more fun fact there's an optional

tow package for the Polestar 2

that allows it to tow up to 2 000 pounds

so yeah go get that jet ski

if the Polestar 2 seems pricey the chevy

bolt hyundai kona ev

and nissan leaf are cheaper ways to

drive electric

more direct competitors include the much

pricier jaguar i-pace

and audi e-tron of course the tesla

model 3 is another big name to consider

for less than a Polestar 2 you can buy

a model 3 performance that'll drive

farther

and accelerate faster though it might

also have trim and body alignment issues

there are a lot of factors to consider

here

[Music]

deciding which electric car is best will

depend on your needs and taste

but as we know competition improves the

breed and the Polestar 2

is most definitely competitive

[Music]
