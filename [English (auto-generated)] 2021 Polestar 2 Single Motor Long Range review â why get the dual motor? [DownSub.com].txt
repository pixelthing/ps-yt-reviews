hello and welcome back to the channel of

nonsense i'm about to go and get on a

train because

i review trains now it's what i do times

are tough

[Music]

it handles like it's on rails

now obviously that was nonsense i'm not

really here to review a train although

this was

a 250 pound train ride for someone i'm

here to drive a

Polestar single motor so um that's

tomorrow

driving the cheaper more affordable

Polestar 2 um i'm going to go into my

castle we'll be arriving at

i'm going to drink some wine and

tomorrow i'm going to wake up refreshed

and detracted yeah

and i'm gonna drive the car i don't get

this in my lay by and sorry i just get

interrupted by

if you're leaving us here please make

sure you take all your

[Music]

oh sorry i don't know what that train

nonsense was about anyway

i'm up here on the beautiful kind of

scottish borders where there are dragons

and stuff

to drive the Polestar 2. now i drove

the dual motor version

of the beautiful Polestar 2 last year

i'll stick a link up there so you can

click on that

this is more the thinking person's

version of the Polestar 2.

it's only got a single motor on the

front axle it's a bit cheaper

and it can go further because it's not

trying to be fast so

i'm going to take you for a walk around

do a full review take it for a drive and

tell you if i think you should get the

dual motor or just

the single motor will do so yeah let's

get on with it

less waffle look at this beautiful

england just basically scotland right so

whereas the dual motor version

of the Polestar 2 will set you back

about 50 000 pounds

this will set you back 43 000 pounds and

there's one below this as well

which is about 39 40 000 pounds with a

smaller battery so this is called the

single motor

long range it has a 78 kilowatt hour

battery

which is good for 330 miles which is

quite a lot of miles and probably

about as many as you'd need to do sorry

335 miles

and you can charge it at 150 kilowatts

so you can get from whatever five to

eighty percent

in about half an hour now the dual motor

version

has about 298 ish miles of range so you

get an extra 30 in this

and if you want to save even more

pennies and get the 40 grand one you the

64 kilowatt hour battery

that'll do 263 miles does that make

sense so yeah this is the longest range

Polestar 2 you can currently get one

thing i think poster does

really well is they make all of the post

r2s kind of look the same

so you can't tell that you've bought the

cheap one by looking at it

apart from there's a tiny little sticker

down here which kind of says

how many motors and what batteries it's

got and all that kind of stuff

so yeah this has got some options on it

it's got six grand of the plus pack

which adds things like the big

panoramic roof heated everything inside

and a 600 watt

harman kardon hard on sound system and a

few other bits and pieces

i'm still a big fan of the way the

Polestar 2 looks

that kind of slightly lifted look it's

kind of slightly

cubist side profile let's have a look

around the back

you've got that big light strip across

the back and you've got

a 405 liter boot

which is going to be really dark there

we go a 405 liter boot there with all my

stuff in it and there's a little 35

liter front as well so it's reasonably

practical

as far as these things go now one of the

other options you can get which this car

doesn't have

is the performance pack which adds uh

yellow seat belts

oh yeah and different brake calipers

erlens dampers and a few other things

a cool little nerdy fact about those

erlens dampers

is they're set up differently for each

country so the uk ones get a slightly

softer setting

than sweden and places like that another

delightfully nerdy fact is that all the

tyres

that you can get on all the different

variants of the Polestar 2

are poster specific they're a special

kind of

tread and compound and everything else

designed to work with the car they say

pull on them

the few other cool details on the car

you get frameless side mirrors which

look super premium and super nice and

when you adjust the mirrors

this whole housing moves so it's better

and smaller and more aerodynamic

and it just looks really posh and

obviously you look at them all the time

you're driving hopefully so it looks

good

you can't see it because it's bright

sunlight this is a glass roof and a pole

star logo

shines up into it like the bat symbol

right let's have a look in the back

seats the rear passenger space is

actually pretty good considering

you know it's not a massive car i can

get in here really easily behind my

driving position he says grunting so

even with the panoramic roof which comes

as part of that 4 000 pound plus pack

i've still got headroom and i've got leg

room as well so it's actually quite

spacious in here

kids will be fine adults will be fine as

well um i'm quite warm though so

apologies

uh for the sweat i should point out as

well that all Polestar 2s as default come

with a vegan interior is only when you

add like the optional leather that it

becomes

unvegan d vegan meaty whatever you want

to call it

right let's go up front up front i

really like the Polestar 2's interior

you get nice simple steering wheel

with your cruise control buttons and

bits and bobs on there it's

dead easy to use and the dashboard

is really straightforward to use as well

so if i kind of sit in it there's no

start button for this car you just jump

in

put it in drive and then you're ready to

go and you can basically see where

you're going

in there so all the sound i have is done

through google maps here

and it is dead straightforward dead

simple and the voice commands

just work you can just say take me to an

obscure shop and it will take you to

exactly the shop you asked for and then

it will display the google maps

in the dash as well which i wish more

car manufacturers make things this easy

there's only really two modes to kind of

set the dash to you kind of see this one

with your range and your next directions

and your charging percentage

or you can see this one which has got

the maps and everything else

now obviously this is all done through a

touch screen but it's really

straightforward to use and you can kind

of see

all your aircon controls really easily

by tapping down there

so you have got physical buttons for um

defrosting front and rear windows there

and then

you've got your driving modes which are

dead straight forward as well you kind

of set your one pedal driving down here

i'll talk about that in the driving bit

the creep

and the steering feel and then all your

driver assists and there is an optional

pilot pack

you can put on this the lane keeping aid

has an error

because i'm parked off-road where

there's lots of sheep and stuff

and then you can set your charging

parameters there and what kind of speed

you want to charge at and reviewing you

want to charge 70

blah blah blah the rest of the interior

is really nice this one's kind of got

this um

open pour wood stuff big fan of that

gray textile

it just feels lovely and you've got

these really sexy head restraints as

well which being

you know linked vaguely to volvo and

Geely are going to be

really good in a crash seats are super

comfortable you've got a wireless

charging mat

down there which comes as part of the

plus pack and you've got a cubby with

cup holders and bits and bobs

down there i just want to say it kind of

looks almost minimalist and a bit dull

in here but it's really comfortable and

there's little things like

the gear lever just feels really

comfortable to rest your hand on

it's just a nice experience and nice

driving for

kind of feel when you get in it and

there you go you've got a frameless

rear view mirror as well right it's more

enough waffle from me about the interior

and the looks of the car let's just go

for a drive and see if it feels as

interesting to drive

as that dual motor version let's go

right i want to go for a drive

in my Polestar 2 single motor

long range and this is what i love about

the Polestar 2.

it is just so easy to live with and get

on with and

drive you just hop in this little key

thing you just

chuck that in with you there's no start

button just put your foot on the brake

pull that back into d google maps knows

where i'm going

and then you just put your foot down and

off you go

now this is the single motor version so

it doesn't have the ferocious punch

of the dual motor not to 62 mile an hour

is 7.4 seconds which sounds a little bit

slow but

like all electric cars it feels faster

than it is on paper so i put my foot

down at 30

and yeah 50 60.

it feels quick still top speed 99 miles

an hour

limited kind of irrelevant really most

electric cars

and i have to say having driven the dual

motor version

last year other than acceleration this

really doesn't feel

very different to drive at all it rides

really well for an electric car it's

just

it's quite supple and the fact that it

only just weighs two tons means that

it hasn't got like lardy rolling a

beltiness in corners that you get from

most electric cars which feel like

a sumo wrestler trying to do the hula

hoop thing this doesn't feel like that

and actually it's just a really calm

place to be

and the ride helps that now obviously

you can get like adjustable erlens

dampers with

the performance pack if you want but i

wouldn't bother

this is absolutely fine

when you start hooning it and driving it

quickly it just keeps up

with what you want to do it doesn't

throw any weight related history

histrionics look through these corners

it's just

gripping and going i think perhaps you

get a little bit more traction control

intervention

when you floor out of tight corners you

get the light flickering occasionally

but you can't feel it holding the power

back in the dual motor you probably

wouldn't get that so much because you've

got the rear motor helping you out

but yeah it's not an understeer monster

it rides really well it handles

pretty brilliantly it has to be said

obviously it's not like a laugh a minute

sports car anything like that

cattle grid barely felt it

cautioned sheep on the road yeah it's

only just over

occasional jumps in the road when you're

going like a hooligan where it

does noticeably grab the power but

that's quite

rare i have to say this is

probably one of the nicest evs

to drive in a kind of spirited manner it

might not be you know

laugh-a-minute dual motor tesla kind of

fun but it's

more sophisticated and going to

front-wheel drive

has not really harmed it one bit as far

as i can tell in the driving dynamics

and obviously the payoff

is that you get more range than the dual

motor with the same

75 kilowatt-hour battery that this has

got

so yes i'm i'm very impressed and the

thing is when you're on a motorway

it's still so refined in here that it

just becomes like a big

snuggly hot tub sex pond whatever you

want to call them

that you just fall into and go yes get

me home

relax it's great it just does everything

you need it to

really really well without feeling

like a lardy ev because it's not really

especially lardy compared to the rest of

them

talk about the boring stuff the

visibility out the back is not

great the rear window is pretty small

and it's hammered a bit by the headrests

on the outer rear seats but they've got

proper headrests which is good for like

not getting whiplash when you crash over

shoulder visibility is fine if you don't

have a gopro in your face

and yeah it's just very easy to live

with very easy to drive

it's also very comfortable to rest your

hand on the gear selector which is not

something

i often talk about but i was chatting to

a chauffeur a proper professional

chauffeur yesterday

he was driving me to the train station

in one of these and he said

i've noticed that resting my hand here

is like holding my wife's hand while

driving along

i think he must have a robot wife with a

bionic hand with a hole in the middle of

it but it is comfortable

to rest your hand on nonetheless

look overtaking a cyclist mid-range

acceleration

is really good it's one of those cars

that you know might not feel massively

rapid off the line but you floor it at

40 to 70 and it's like

oh yeah yeah quite quick

quite quick now you've got three modes

of one pedal driving you just press the

car up there to adjust it

you have off low and standard if you put

it in standard

you lift off the accelerator and it's

like you're putting the brakes on

i just keep it in low so you get some

regeneration

but it doesn't come to a stop and you

can turn creep on and off in that menu

as well

and you can change the steering feel

between light standard and firm as well

just leave it standard and you can put

the stability control in sport mode as

well but i've not bothered to be honest

i'm not sure many others will

and that's nice that you can just flick

between all that at the touch for menu

sure it's through the touchscreen but

it's literally one tap

or very big virtual buttons away i'm not

gonna whinge about that

all right that's probably enough

waffling from me about how the polestar

2 single motor long range

does drive back to you timothy for an

outro

only my mother calls me timothy anyway

no comments about my mother so i've come

to the end of about four or five hours

with the Polestar 2 single motor

long range i've driven some of the uk's

best roads i've had an amazing time so

good that i

kind of forgot to put gopros on for the

best bits but anyway

what do i think of it well is a bloody

good car still and it doesn't really

lose much

in only having one motor sure you lose

some of the off the line

acceleration and perhaps some of the

handling kind of dynamism and torque

vectoring

type-y stuff isn't there but i've had a

blast with this i've been driving

fun roads and i've had fun i've not had

that feeling that

oh i'm in an ev i wish i was in a hot

hatch

i've not had that the body control is

really good for a two-ton

car and it goes into corn as well comes

out of them well it drags itself up

hills

better than a petrol engine car because

instant torque

being really impressed by it on the fun

side of things but obviously we know

it's a practical car

good on motorways decent range that 330

mile

technical range is probably more like

270 in the real world

i'm kind of blown away and i sort of

want one

as an everyday proposition the user

experience of the interior

the infotainment the google maps the

fact that there's no nonsense in there

it's just you and the car that works

and it works very well so yeah five

stars out of five for the polestar

single motor long range

i love it and i want one i think i've

said that already anyway thank you so

much for watching please hit like if

you've liked this video

leave a comment call me a horrible

syphilitic old crone or something like

that

and do subscribe if you want more

nonsense like this because there's more

coming soon

thank you goodbye right i'm going to try

and

get this car back over there and not run

over one of the three brides that are

here

lots of weddings that weird lump was my

microphone i haven't suddenly got a

cubist collarbone

why not
