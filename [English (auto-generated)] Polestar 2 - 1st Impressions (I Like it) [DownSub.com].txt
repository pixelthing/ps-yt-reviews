hello and welcome to evie review ireland

my name is derek reilly we are in

western airfield in dublin and ireland

and we're at the launch of polestar

which is just coming into ireland it's

22nd market and it's launching with the

Polestar

2.

so let's have a quick look around the

car

inside outside first then inside and

take it for a quick drive i have the car

for around 90 minutes so it'll be a

quick run around

love the styling on this and it is very

much about style the polstar ceo is a

the ex head of design for volvo and so

they have the ceo

designer and they also have their own

head of design so it's uh there's a lot

of design going on here

really nice

Polestar badging which is the north

stair you have this techno grill with

the sensors in the front of it

and then you have because the parent

company

also are the performance element of

volvo when it's separated now and you

have

it is a

partner

and it's overall owner then is the jeely

motor company out of china but you'll

see that volvo inspiration throughout it

with that the likes of the headlight

with the power hammer

beautiful led lights

and you have depending on the model

whether you're going to have fog lights

or not down in here

moving along then you've got some active

arrow in underneath

there is a trunk inside as well

so we'll open up that in a bit but

style-wise at the front comes in a

number of different colors and

i really like the look of it

i like that fastback look i like the

angularity of it and i like the fact

that it's a bit more traditional looking

car wise with that grille some people

prefer the tesla model 3. i was parked

in front of the hangar door and they had

to open it up but anyway we'll move down

alongside is that you get 19 and 20 inch

wheels you have this pro the graphics on

the door talking about the model the

size of the battery and the um

whether you've got the performance pack

etc some glass or some matte black

cladding on the wheel arches and down

along the side you have these protruding

handles which is refreshing from the

aero stuff that we're getting all over

so it's nice substantial

has a light and

glass black a pillar b pillar and then

that c pillar then is in body color

charging port is on the passenger side

ac is 11 dc i think is 135 but i'll

confirm that

overall i really like it nice strong

shoulder line as well

and it has that extra crease then midway

down um concave

beautifully designed

i'm a big fan

those frameless mirrors are gorgeous as

well

let's have a look around the back down

along the back and being a fastback

you've got that hatch we'll talk about

that in a second but you have this real

distinctive which is an ev signifier now

pretty much with a lot more not just evs

it has a led light part that goes all

the way along 288 leds you have your

upholster logo

i thought that either there'd be a

button here or here but it's in

underneath here

your matte black clad and then with your

parking sensors etc

great access in over 400 liters worth of

space which isn't huge but the fact that

it has that hatch opening definitely

helps you have that false floor and that

well underneath 12 volt tire points 60

40 and the 40 split is unusually on the

other side than what we're normally used

to which is great and you've got that

ski hatch coming through as well so

practicality between this which is over

400 just over 400 liters and then the

front which is over 70 i think it's 71

liters

and then putting the seats down at 1700

liters lots of usability lots of space

in that and that power tail lift is

great

let's have a look on the inside

[Music]

when you get in you really notice the

design on those wing mirrors and those

handles they're so easy to find

and very easy to open up so you have a

12 odd inch 12 inch 12.3 inch i think it

is

fact sheet hold on a second they've got

a press sheet internally here

for all the stats and all the figures so

let's not guess let's get it right

so we have a large driver infotainment

scene large driver in cluster apologies

in instrument cluster

the driver dismissed what they're

calling it and it is 12.3 inch uh hd

driver display or the info pill as they

call it

uh when it is being when it's charging

so from the outside it illuminates in

kind of a pill shape in yellow and it

tells you what's left to get to church

i'm this week currently driving the

volvo xc 40 single motor uh review

coming to the channel soon and a lot of

the switch gear is very similar as much

as this is a Polestar three spoke

steering wheel the

buttons on the left and right hand side

are very volvo-esque

uh the gear selector as much as there's

a volvo or a Polestar

it is again a volvo it's a very similar

volatile switch gear so good to see that

they're using that quality product as

well

dash wise this one doesn't have a

head-up display i don't know if a

head-up display is an option actually i

didn't see one

it has a lovely textured um soft

rubberized plastic you've got some

fabric in here you've got some textured

diamond effect

decent sized glove box which is great to

see on a left and right hand drive model

stocks again are vulnerable switch gear

as well

and you have the ability to open the

boot from here

memory seats in this model um

two positions all your electrics here

for your windows your center lock and

then your ring mirrors

lovely little button on the handle here

design feature i thought it did

something but it's actually just

aesthetic large center console and for

an ev it's

unusual to see it

this

um in

display

center screen is

11.15 inches it has android automotive

built in has over the air updates

wireless charging pad you've got a

volume selector here but everything is

done through the screen you've got some

quick access to d mists you've got

reverse neutral drive single cup holder

and then a second one in the armrest if

you want it and this one

can be removed i think by the looks of

things yeah i can

if you want to take it out

if you just wanted a full

cubby hole there

otherwise no sunroof in this option and

depends on the pack so they're not doing

too many individual options they are

doing packs

prices wise let's get the fact sheet up

here which is very handy for us uh it

comes in la standard range single motor

in ireland it starts at 54 500 then we

have long range

single motor and then long range zoom

water so it's 54 500 for the single

motor standard range um and then battery

and that is

69 kilowatt hours and then the battery

in the long range

is 78 kilowatt hours usable on those are

67 and 75.

so at the standard range starting at 54

500 and then the long range dual motor

jumping up to 61 900 and if you want the

plus pack and the uh performance pack

that jumps it up then to

just under 75 000 73 74 000 depending on

um

the single motors obviously are all

front-wheel drive um not obviously which

they're on one of the axles and then the

uh dual motor is all-wheel drive it has

165 kilowatts starting

with the single range going all the way

up to 300 kilowatts uh brake horsepower

224 to again up to over 400 newton

meters torque 330 all the way up to 660.

um performance wise you're doing 7.4

seconds

then down to 4.7 for the dual motor

energy consumption is between

16.7 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers

all the way up to just around the 20

mark range 474

um to 482 that's wltp and it has a drag

coefficient of 0.27 lots of stats here

it's a 400 volt architecture system we

talked about the battery size

dc it's up to 155

and then for the standard range single

motor and for the dual motors the long

range uh sorry the bigger battery the

long range dual and single motor that

goes up to 155 so depending on what size

battery pack will dictate what size dc

you get in it charging time ac um

around the seven to eight hours

uh if you're getting it um at the 11

kilowatts that it can take and then for

dc from 10 to 80 about 35 minutes so

pretty standard range stuff length is

2.7 meter sorry 4.6 meters with a

wheelbase of 2.7 um

towing capacity it can also tough 1500

kgs

roof load if you uh you can put 75 kgs

on the top of it

we talked about the alloys 19-inch all

the way up to

20-inch there is on the performance pack

you get the brembo brakes you get the

forged

alloy wheels and you also get that 22

way dampeners adjustable dampeners if

you want that performance pack and

that's the one that has the gold

seats or sleepouts as well a couple of

cars here today and there was a larger

press crew so i wasn't able to get that

one unfortunately but hopefully we'll

get it on the uh press drive when we get

it out and about

so built-in android automotive lots of

stats there let's jump in the back and

see what the rear space is like

i'm 188 centimeters high tall six foot

two um let's

seat set for me

jump in the back

there's a lovely design feature on the

uh rear glass element it looks like it's

glass but it's actually dark it's not

see through on the door when you get in

uh bench is a bit high um actually not

bad high support feet can go in

underneath the seat in front of me and

they're nearly touching the seat in

front of me i feel i'm higher up so i

think there's a kind of a bench system

here

where it's staggered up and obviously

the battery pack is underneath there is

a transmission tunnel

so a middle passenger would be difficult

uh maybe not that comfortable we've got

two isofix in the rear you have a rear

headrest so that they're thinking about

it and you have the cup holders here as

well

and we said we have that 60 40 split

underneath the flap we have

again very volatile esque

maybe it's only accessible from the rear

yes it is only accessible from the rear

interesting

head height

probably

two or three centimeters

so yeah it's just with that without the

panoramic some of it is a small bit

cramped

um

for my height

you have

some air vents you have

two usb type cs

take a fair drive

so it's not too deep of a

front it is wide but good size here

and it's nicely carpeted as well so all

the chargers can go in there

we've got a plane taken off over here in

westin so not sure what the audio is

going to be like

what's it like driving the Polestar 2

yeah it's very accomplished you can feel

that it's um it's set up for driving

um

it's not as hard to ride as the recent

model y i had

steering was good size

it is that volvo size so it is uh

it's nice and chunky

driver display is good infotainment

screen is good seats are comfortable

it's got that nice side ball stirred

you're a nice height as well your

traditional fastback saloon sedan height

go this way

[Music]

um

we'll give it on the m4

just to see what the motorway noise is

like

jeffer

a quick spin around it's hard with these

shorter press elements to to get a

better driving impression when you have

the car for longer uh i'll be able to do

a proper

maybe a coaster coaster

a more in-depth review but initial

impressions i like it it's comfortable

it's refined

it seems quiet

but we'll confirm that once we hit the

motorway

make sure you've subscribed to the

channel if you haven't already done so

as i talked about at the beginning we're

on a big drive to 10 000 by the end of

the year so

it would be it'd be a great help if you

could

like a lot of cars nowadays you also

have an app and look how beautiful this

one is designed nice clean and clear

you've got doors opened or unlocked or

unlocked climb it on climb it off

but very

stylish and design led very much like

the car itself

so yeah there is an app availability and

that connectivity there

let me know in the comments if you've

already ordered one if you're currently

driving one these have been out since

2020

so they're a bit late coming to the

market here in ireland but they're

operating in a number of different

markets

and they'll be opening up in a number of

different markets over the coming months

and years

and we're going to get the

pull start 3 which is the suv the luxury

suv next year Polestar 4 and 2024 and then

the pulse r5 which is their precept

which we saw um

their flagship sports car

that's going to be in 2025. interesting

to see

production for Polestare

is currently in two locations in china

and that and then also in the united

states in a volvo factory i think it's

in charleston it's where they mentioned

it so the

Polestar usa

made vehicles will be for the u.s market

and china will look after the rest of

the rest of the world

just coming out of the m4 here now now

it's 80 kilometers an hour so

i'm not gonna get much speed up but

[Music]

let's try google assistant hey google

navigate to western airport dublin

navigating to western airport

so because it has google built in it's

also telling me what the percentage

battery is

on arrival which will be 95

um

display here on the center console but

also on the driver display lovely big

wide

12 inch

screen

yeah good information being given to me

so with the drive modes you get three

different levels of steering feel

and then you've got one pedal driving

standard low or off and then you've got

creep off or not driver assist then you

can have cruise control driver alerts

collision avoidance lane keeping road

sign and ready to drive notifications

when somebody pulls off in front of you

good big charging information there and

you can set the charge limit

and what amperage you want and you can

also schedule it and then you can

um gives you the charging status

uh sorry the car status as to if there's

anything issue with the likes of the

tire pressures etc uh configurator is

going to be launched in the next couple

of weeks it's going to be based in

sandiford in dublin

and spirit motor group are going to be

the partners here servicing in ireland

you're going to be working with volvo

garages because of that volvo connection

so if you've got a volvo garage nearby

that's where you would bring in your

polester if you ever need to bring it in

hopefully you've enjoyed today's look

around the Polestar 2 make sure you've

subscribed to the channel like the video

leave a comment and remember if you

think an eevee is for you leave it to me

and i'll review thank you very much for

watching
