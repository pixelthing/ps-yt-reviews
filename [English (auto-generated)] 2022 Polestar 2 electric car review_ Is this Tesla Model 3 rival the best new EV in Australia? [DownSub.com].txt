here at car's guide we get to bring you

new car reviews all the time but it's

rare that we get to introduce you to a

brand and drive its first model in

australia this rather good looking ev

here is the Polestar 2 and you should

care about it because for the first time

it's a car that's uniquely positioned to

really take on tesla's dominant model 3.

we're going to see if this new swedish

player has what it takes but before we

do did you know we have a dedicated ev

site section over at

carsguy.com where you'll be able to read

the full written review of the pollstar

2 here and every other ev that launches

into the market we've also got loads of

news and advice that should help answer

all of your ev questions

now before we go on we are going to

split this review into our eight review

subheads you'll see them on your screen

now skip ahead to the part that

interests you if you are watching on

youtube they'll be in the timeline or

the description below as well and if you

will help you keep up to date with all

of our latest content let's get into it

some of you might be wondering what even

is polstar and we'll get to that in a

second but we need to talk about pricing

because it's key to why this model is so

important for the ev landscape in

australia

polstar surprised us all earlier this

year when it revealed its first car

would start wearing an msrp of just 59

900 which matches its key tesla model 3

rival that entry price buys you the

standard range two wheel drive model

which scores a range of up to 470

kilometers 19-inch alloy wheels an 11.5

inch portrait oriented and google

integrated multimedia suite premium

audio dual zone climate control full led

lighting vegan interior trim made of all

sorts of recycled stuff and some but not

all of the available safety features

we'll take a look at that later stepping

up to the long range scores you the same

kit but with a larger 78 kilowatt hour

battery good for a driving range of up

to 540 kilometers you see the price on

your screen now but keep in mind it

undercuts the equivalent long range

tesla model 3 by a decent margin

stepping up once again to the

performance spiced long range dual motor

scores you the same kit again but this

time with nearly double the performance

and all-wheel drive albeit with slightly

less range

while standard gear remains the same you

can customize every car with a choice of

pricey but extensive packs the plus pack

adds an even more premium audio system

premium vegan upholstery extended

interior lighting panoramic sunroof

electric adjust for the driver and

passenger seats a wireless phone charger

tinted rear windows and a heat pump

which can use the heat from the

drivetrain to more efficiently support

this car's temperature altering

functions like the air conditioning

next is the pilot pack which adds the

extended safety suite to include blind

spot monitoring and rear cross traffic

alert and also rear auto braking

importantly this kit also includes the

adaptive cruise suite with pilot assist

and a 360 degree surround view camera

you'll also get auto dimming rear wing

mirrors enhanced led headlights with

cornering function and animated turn

signals finally only the dual motor

all-wheel drive model can be fitted with

the performance pack which grants it

20-inch alloy wheels clad and

continental tires brembo four-piston

brakes dual flow dampers and gold

highlights throughout if you so wish you

can choose those 20-inch wheels on their

own as well as ventilated leather seats

and premium paint options

now hopefully you've come to terms with

this car's clearly appealing price in

the ev space establishing itself as a

genuine tesla competitor it's time to

look at its design

if the seemingly appealing price hasn't

grabbed you then the design certainly

will have you seen this car it's really

quite good looking and like the model 3

before it i think it's destined to turn

heads until there are too many of them

on the roads but have you seen those

light fittings before i think you have

i'll show you why

to understand why the Polestar 2 is

looking so good yet somehow a little

familiar we need to understand the brand

itself you see polstar is an offshoot of

its parent companies volvo cars out of

sweden and julie holding out of china

this means it can borrow from volvo for

its platforms and design whilst

utilizing the supply chains of geely in

china where the ev market is much more

developed

in fact pollstar's headquarters is in

the same complex as volvo in sweden

while the majority of its cars including

the ones destined for australia are

built in factories in china as to its

appealing looks pollstar's ceo used to

be a designer himself and while the

pollstar 2 borrows a lot from its volvo

cousins for now the brand promises it

will move further away from its roots

and become experimental and

controversial in the design department

as time goes on

that's not to say the Polestar 2 isn't a

statement all on its own i think we need

to stop for a moment and celebrate the

fact that it cuts a sedan-like

silhouette in the era of suvs but like

many new evs it's unconventional

bringing a tall ride height crossover

highlights and a rear lift back which

adds up to something that stands apart

on the road the proportions are tough

but fun striking but approachable you

can count me as a fan taking a look

inside the Polestar 2 and while some

elements like the steering wheel will be

familiar from volvo products this car is

more paired back and makes even more of

a minimalist scandinavian statement the

portrait screen has been freed from its

frame with the bespoke software design

developed alongside google and part of

polstar's unique brand promise is

extensive use of sustainable and

recycled interior materials to that end

various materials in the cabin are made

of recycled bottles and there's even use

of sustainably sourced biomaterials like

flax polstar promises there'll be more

extensive use of these kinds of things

in the future to read more about this

check out the full written review over

on carsguy.com dot a u

the interior feels the part i'm

surprised to find how starkly different

it is not only from its tesla rival in

terms of this upright design and

closed-in sporty feel but i'm also

surprised at how different it is from

its volvo relations this

screen is freed from its chains this

wheel even though it's the same is

seated quite differently and the raised

console communicates the brand's idea of

making polstar a bit more

individualistic than the family

all-encompassing feel of volvo polstar

promises it's also thought of some

practicality elements of this car a bit

differently so let's see if that's true

[Music]

okay so polstar says it wants to revisit

and intentionally break some rules when

it comes to interior design this means

like the teslas some things are quite

different in here there's no ignition

you just hop in and you're good to go

the dash is designed not to be

distracting with simple shapes and

there's a focus on user experience with

this big tablet screen most of the

functions have moved here and i was

surprised to find that the slick

software that's been developed alongside

google was actually very good at not

annoying me and thankfully you still get

a real digital dash to help it in

feeling like a car i never liked how the

tesla model 3 tried to remove it

interestingly apple carplay support is

not available at launch so those with an

iphone like me will be left using only

bluetooth functions but i'm told this

type of connectivity is planned to be

added in the future with a simple

over-the-air update storage-wise you've

got a large trench in the door there

which holds our biggest cars guide

bottle here and one in this center

console as well

there's one hidden in this armrest

console box but you kind of have to

choose whether you're going to have a

cup holder or an armrest box there which

is a bit of a shame there's a wireless

charger and two hidden usb c ports in

the back seat of the polstar 2 and i was

surprised to find how much knee room and

headroom i have behind my own seating

position that's really impressive to see

the nice trim continues as well and

you've got two heated seats with three

levels back here a power outlet and

adjustable air vents as well in terms of

storage you have a

small bottle holder in the door which

just holds our car's guide bottle here

and two more in the drop down armrest

now one downside related to the fact

that this car shares its platform with

combustion volvos is there's still a

transmission shaft here which means

compared to most electric cars there's

less leg room especially for that center

passenger

the boot measures in at 405 litres which

is more than some hatchbacks but less

than what you'd might expect from an

equivalent midsize suv

it just fits our entire car's guide

luggage set as you can see but to close

it with the final case on top you do

need to remove the luggage cover there's

also a small amount of room under the

floor for charging equipment like any

true ev the polstar 2 also has a frunk

now it's not very good for storing

luggage because it is quite small

especially on all-wheel drive models but

it is good for keeping your charging

paraphernalia pulstar actually includes

a type 2 to type 2 cable as well which

you know is valued between 250 and 350

dollars and most brands don't include

this so that's quite a polite inclusion

as well

[Music]

the polstar 2 features two powertrains

across three variants the standard range

packs a single motor driving the front

wheels which can provide respectable

power figures you'll see on your screen

now

step up to the all-wheel drive dual

motor version though and a second nearly

equally powerful motor is added at the

rear for almost double the performance

that makes the top car the one we're

testing for this review properly quick

these motors are shared with volvo's

incoming range of electric cars and

they're backed by a 400 volt lithium ion

battery pack in either 78 or 69 kilowatt

hour forms depending on which variant

you choose

what does this add up to behind the

wheel though let's take a look

[Music]

driving the Polestar 2 and i was so

pleased to find that this car still

brings a lot of those new fresh

experiences that we're seeing with a lot

of these new ev models and i think a lot

of that is down to the very shape of

this car the fact that it's a slinky

sedan

with an suv ride height it just brings

something a little special and a little

different it doesn't feel like a midsize

suv to drive and doesn't feel like a

sedan to drive it feels somewhere in the

middle and that ride height and

suspension travel gives this car virtues

which so few electric cars can achieve

not only does it handle quite well which

we'll get to in a second

but it also carries the weight of its 78

kilowatt hours of batteries

really really well it doesn't have that

burdened feeling that a lot of ev

versions of combustion cars get and it

doesn't get the unwieldy feeling that

some pure evs get it it really does feel

balanced with a lot of poise over both

axles and it's really unusual to see it

doesn't have many of the negatives that

we usually associate with the drive

experience of an ev at all now keep in

mind we are only driving this top spec

car with the performance dampers and

that might change things quite a bit

compared to the more entry-level models

where i actually expect the lion's share

of sales will be but that having been

said it's important to know anyway

because if you're considering this car

against a model 3 you should know that

the model 3 has quite a brittle hard

ride whereas this car is both

comfortable

while keeping that kind of playful feel

in the corners

and it's just all around a really nicely

composed package now i do apologize for

constantly comparing it to the model 3

but the other thing you should know is

that this top spec performance version

isn't as sledgehammer fast as the model

3 performance is

and i think that's more to do with this

car's relation to volvo it still has

that volvo dna of being measured in its

response to things of being a little bit

more comfortable and secure and those

things don't really

help it make the most of

what an electric drivetrain can achieve

but it's still ridiculously fast anyway

so i don't think you need any more power

from this the

ludicrous and unleashed modes that the

teslas can do are wholly unnecessary

so i think this car still achieves a

really nice balance of

the smooth electric motoring on offer

here but also

you know it's still fast and it's still

capable and it's still grippy on the

road

and to have this quality of ride and

this performance at a price that is not

only

under a hundred thousand dollars for a

premium brand but also

dangerously close to some of its

more mainstream rivals is ridiculous now

other more ev specific things yes you've

got dual motors in here yes it's fast

yes it's really secure on the road but

you've also got your regenerative

braking and that's all indicated through

your dash here and it's pretty pretty

good really

the only thing i'll note about it is

there is only one regen mode and it's

it's pretty aggressive and computer

controlled uh so that's worth keeping in

mind as well there's no adjustable

levels like there is in some other evs

particularly from hyundai

the only other thing that i didn't find

quite so good about it was

as you get up to those freeway speeds

maybe 80 kilometers an hour and above it

just

gets a little bit noisy in the cabin you

start to get a bit more tire noise you

start to get a bit more wind noise and

some rivals have really really drilled

down and addressed this with things like

noise cancelling speakers and acoustic

glass

and that's not quite

a feature here apparently in this car it

just does get a little bit noisier at

those higher speeds but

it's no noisier than i'd say a

combustion car would be so you've got to

keep that in mind as well you know the

bar is set quite high for evs and

another thing that surprised me was the

feel of the steering i expected the

steering to be quite a bit heavier than

it is in this car there are three modes

you can adjust there's a standard mode a

heavy mode and a light mode but i found

that the standard mode was quite a bit

lighter than it was in the volvo

electric xc40 that i drove

which surprised me it feels a little bit

more

electrically assisted than that car too

which sort of removes a little bit of

the feel from those front wheels

but on the whole it's it's a really

really nice steering tune and it keeps

this car feeling light and playful and

not like it's too heavy which a lot of

evs can feel like

the Polestar 2 is claimed to consume an

amount of energy a little higher than

some rivals you'll see the numbers on

your screen now

our all-wheel drive car overshot this

number slightly on our test but keep in

mind it was a brief test seeking the

open road so with more time around town

i expect the regen braking system will

have you matching or exceeding the

numbers you'll see on your screen

for charging it uses a european type 2

ccs charging port which is the most

popular kind in australia and on dc it

can charge at a max rate of 155

kilowatts for long-range versions or 130

kilowatts for the standard range version

you'll note this isn't as fast as some

of its even higher voltage rivals from

audi porsche hyundai and tesla but it

will still get the car from 10 to 80

charge in just 35 minutes

on the slower ac charging which is more

commonly found at supermarkets and

council car parks the Polestar 2 can

charge at a max rate of 11 kilowatts

this matches most of its rivals and the

standard range will charge on one of

these units in seven hours while the

long range versions will charge in eight

hours that sounds slow but it's nice to

be able to regain a decent distance

during your grocery shop

one downside for our Polestar 2 unlike the

nissan leaf or hyundai ioniq 5 it

doesn't feature two-way charging so you

can't use the car to power external

devices

polstar likes to say its separate

identity from volvo means it can

experiment with more outlandish concepts

but it also means it can pull a bit of

an unvolvo move of putting select safety

items in an optional pack while you'll

get this suite of high-end safety items

you'll see on your screen now and

rethought impact protection systems for

the ev era standard alongside a suite of

seven airbags the Polestar 2 places its

rear-facing active safety equipment and

the adaptive crew system in the pricey

pilot pack now if you're buying a

polstar 2 i'd strongly recommend this

pack anyway for two reasons firstly it's

worth it and secondly because even with

that box ticked you're still under the

eevee rebate threshold in new south

wales and victoria on the base car it is

still a little unfortunate that you need

to spend extra though regardless

polstar carries the same warranty

promise as its established volvo cousins

in australia with five years and

unlimited kilometres and a separate

8-year and 160 000 kilometer warranty

for the high voltage components the

brand's local division says you'll be

able to service the polstar 2 at some of

the same locations you can take volvos

as they use the same motors and hardware

finally a proper rival to tesla's model

3 and who would have thought it comes

from an all-new swedish player the

Polestar 2 is a triumph in its design its

performance but most importantly its

price and i'll be surprised if it

doesn't take on with australia's

increasingly ev curious population what

do you think would you pick one over

tesla's model 3 tell us in the comments
