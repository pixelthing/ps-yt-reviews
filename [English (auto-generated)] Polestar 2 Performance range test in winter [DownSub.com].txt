this video was brought to you by

stoneburg about the real planner mr

green ken power and marcus bill

yo what's up we're now at iontidal and

behind me here you see Polestar 2 pp

we're going to do range test with it

this is the latest worsen with the heat

pump so it should be more efficient than

before i have one measurement last

winter about four degrees celsius i'm

not sure how cold is now but we have

similar driving condition

but the new updated version so hopefully

we will get a good result the only

problem is that since this is the pp

uh what pp means performance pack

it has michelin oh that's a bit unusual

michelin 245 40 20 inch wheels uh let me

see how to see what

since it's not very common i don't know

what the heck these

these tires are called

and it's a bit smoothie let me show you

here holes are still the same as before

68 kilowatt hour gross capacity around

63 kilowatt on net capacity

okay they're called x ice snow all right

studless tires

so we're just talking about the battery

a little bit ah nice speed uh but the

battery is not uh

optimal temperature but that doesn't

matter okay so what we're going to do is

just do a

part test we don't have to test the

whole battery we already know net

capacity

so the plan is to drive north let me see

hmm

should i just go to stranglish western

alicia

oh sam say just to get this okay let me

check maybe spa that's 60 kilometers to

it this is strong this year okay i guess

strongly sure should be enough

50 kilometers there right no way

is that espa

let me check

it's kind of hard to tell no no no no no

than that that is strong disha yeah oh

sorry for the

exposure this is always um

yeah you see screen is usually more

brighter than than

than the the environment you just don't

notice it but your brain is doing lots

of of hdr processing

but okay yeah that's strongly sure

especially for the knot but this is a

cool feature with the Polestar is that

it will tell you how many percent you

will arrive with

if you go to that location and it's

pretty good at estimating it except for

that

it tends to calculate purely based on

speed limit so um it doesn't detect how

fast or slow you'll be driving we will

actually be driving slightly under the

speed limit now in the 90 test and then

we will go over the speed limit in the

120 test but okay close enough we should

have plenty of juice so off we go

all right so we are on the move now so

we have to cruise at 91 kilometers per

hour on the speed or to match the 90 gps

well it tends to go a little bit over

but it's sometimes over sometimes under

that's fine

um and then

we have this with the new version

we have something called range assistant

you fire up that one you get some

instant numbers and some stuff here so

this is

it could be kind of confusing because we

have projected range 120 kilometers but

in this display it's just been 150

kilometer range

well that's because this app here is a a

separate app similar to tesla when they

have the energy graph where you also see

some range numbers whereas in tesla

that number you usually see in the

screen exactly based on the fixed number

i'm not sure how it is in Polestar or

maybe it's also based on fixed i don't

remember

but okay so many people would say oh

bjorn you have to use this eco climate

mode because eco climate mode will

enable some

uh i don't know torque sleeper i

actually don't know what the heck it

does but it'd been claimed that the the

latest version the 1.7 versus software

version

has the some kind of

optimization of drivetrain to make it

more efficient well my question is why

do we have to enable

something like this to get it more

efficient and i tried it trust me i

tried this feature

in this car and the single motor and the

problem is that every time i enable it

it gets really really cold in here so i

don't want to sacrifice the comfort just

for

if yeah and also i actually haven't

noticed any difference in consumption

except for that i start freezing but

the problem is that this one here resets

every time you start so i tend to forget

to reset it anyway but the main point is

that we shouldn't sacrifice comfort in

winter now when it's

zero degrees outside uh just to stretch

the range a little bit and the

headlights and the poles are here are

the best i have tried ever in any ev

see right now i'm using the adaptive

mode so it turns on automatically and

then it turns off so it will

turn in the curves it will rotate

and also there is a matrix and lots of

segments and it's super responsive some

cars

system they tend to be a bit slow

sluggish but not with this one and also

the the high beam shine really wide and

strong

so i can't show you guys right now but

you guys see the scene before and um

and the dedicated headlight test so um

one thing though let me see no it

doesn't happen here but

i experienced it when i drove through

sweden

on dark uh swedish roads at night that

oncoming traffic they tend to flash at

me

especially when i use the the adaptive

mode

it i feel like it's turning off the the

adaptive lights a bit late and then the

mother truckers on the other side they

flash at me and then it triggers a

mechanism but i think it actually has

something to do with that you know when

you go to driving school they always

teach you that you have to keep the high

beam on until you have a couple of

hundred meters left and then you turn it

off but many people nowadays they tend

to turn off the high beam

500 meters a kilometer away which is

actually too early

you are not really blinded by the light

that far away well unless you have led

bar but um

yeah so that's probably why the truck is

flush at me but also even when i have

low beam you can see that the right side

of the lobium is a bit high-ish which is

good because you want to see animals or

any obstacle on the side of the road

but that

strong

low beam also triggers the truckers to

flash at me it happens all the time even

if i'm in manual mode i don't use

adaptive mode

so

can anything be changed

well if you turn down the lights then

you will have less safety so

i guess that's just the way it is

we are back at ionte filling up some

premium electricity

but okay so this test it was uh 220 watt

up a kilometer one degree uh it was

actually zero degrees during the trip

but look at the distance 64 kilometers

according to google it's 66 kilometers i

also measured during one thousand

kilometer challenge that

this car under reports distance by at

least a roughly 2.5 percent

so that means that the true consumption

is then uh 215 watts per kilometer

so all right now we're going to juice it

can we see how fast we're charging now

oh it's slightly colgate thing hmm we're

supposed to get 150 kilowatts right now

okay but we'll drop a little bit and

then we go for the high speed run

we are now on the 120 test

so um

yes it is loud in here we have 20-inch

wheels

and also the Polestar

is not the most quiet one when it comes

to road noise and

also yeah the bridge gap here

with the pp

we have

well we have adjustable orleans dampers

at least so um

if i own the car i'll probably adjust

them to be slightly more comfortable

i'm not sure what setting it is now it

might be some default setting which is

somewhere in the middle

but

i don't go tracking so that's why yeah

but uh man those headlights bam huh and

like a boss

wow

noise

okay okay i have to turn it off

oh

now what

why did you keep doing this

you can continue your journey now well

but

i

i haven't navigated anyway it keeps

happening all the time

okay anyway

so

high consumption we correct for the

under reporting but it's still high so

we're going to look at the result

afterwards but i want to show you

something here that oh no this isn't

okay

we are charging not at optimal speed the

battery is not that i mean it's getting

warm now but i'm going to do a charting

test so

just as a bonus run we will now go

again once more maybe not the full run a

little bit to the north here

and then back again but what we're going

to do now is that we will navigate to

ionity so that's the new feature with a

version 1.7 software is that

as long as you navigate and we have

something like this

information about charger

the car will then preheat the battery

before fast charging and you will see

that the consumption will be higher so

well i guess it doesn't make sense now

yeah i guess i should leave first before

i do that but okay anyway i think we are

good to go now yeah let's go let's go

so if you look at the result now

in the 90 test we actually got higher

consumption this time versus last time

but it was a couple of degrees higher

temperature last time we tested that was

oh i think it was over a year ago

but remember that that was 19-inch

wheels versus 20-inch wheels here it

could be slightly worse there and then

the high-speed test which i didn't do

last time see that

this car is quite thirsty

as expected

and then as a bonus i also checked now

if we navigated to a fast charge ionity

or which whatever fast charger you see

that the consumption was significantly

higher and if you do the math based on

120 kilometers per hour

it translates to 3.2 kilowatt so that's

the extra power the car pulls for

heating up the battery so this is

actually quite a good indication that

it is working and also when i did 1000km

challenge i also saw that it was working

so yes what should i say about the

consumption and range um

actually based on this i can't really

say if the heat pump is any more

efficient than the one beyond without

heat pump really so

okay at least i did the test now so now

you guys know

so that's gonna be it for now hope you

guys enjoy the video as always thank you

for watching and talk to you later
