volvo created polestar as a home for its

premium electric cars now the polestar 1

which was the first model that was

launched by the brand in 2019 was a

limited edition 600 brake horsepower

plug-in hybrid coupe that cost just

under 140 000 pounds it was really cool

not the most realistic purchase i don't

think i've actually ever seen any on the

road thinking about it however this

is the Polestar 2. now the second pole

star is not only fully electric which is

what they will be from now on but this

is way more affordable starting price of

40 000 pounds

okay not quite as eye-catching as a

postal one but i still think it looks

very nice

you might be thinking that the two in

the name represents the fact that this

is the second Polestar but actually i

think it's the two questions it makes

you ask yourself

number one

is it any good and number two

you guessed it is it as good as a tesla

model three well

let's find out

oh

um

like subscribe and bell button and thank

you

yes another review of an electric car

that talks about tesla but bear with me

because in this case the Polestar 2 is

the most genuine rival to the tesla

model 3.

the entry-level Polestar 2 comes with a 64

kilowatt-hour battery a single electric

motor and can manage a maximum range of

276 miles on a charge a long-range

version is around 3 grand more and has a

78 kilowatt hour battery for a range of

337 miles

another three grand on top of that gets

you this range-topping long-range dual

motor version which has the bigger

battery more power and a range of up to

300 miles

those three are roughly comparable to

the three current versions of the model

3 albeit slightly down on the official

maximum ranges of the tesla across the

board

nevertheless all models of the polestar

2 go far enough on a charge to make it a

very usable electric family car

well i'll tell you what it feels more

than just usable in here this is a

really really lovely interior i mean

yeah it's got that swedish

minimalist vibe going on but it doesn't

feel like stark or basic or anything

there's some nice design touches in here

a little hexagonal gear shifter there

the materials on the dash look and feel

really lovely vegan as well in case like

me you worry about the cows

there are some scratchier plastics lower

down like on the side of the center

console and the steering wheel is quite

obviously a volvo one with a Polestar

badge stuck on it instead but generally

the cabin feels pretty plush and pretty

special tesla interiors certainly have

their own distinctive minimalist style

but sit in a poster too and you

definitely get the feeling that

everything is more solidly built and of

better quality

now the pa resistance which is french

for snazzy bit is this 11.1 inch

infotainment touchscreen and the

resolution is

it runs on an android system rather than

a software that's been designed by

polestar and it's so easy to use it's

really intuitive and it seems like a

really obvious step doesn't it when you

think about how much better smartphone

operating systems are compared to the

average in-car

built infotainment system it seems very

obvious plus

you can use google maps even if you've

got an iphone on the screen

because actually

surprisingly it doesn't have apple car

play at the moment but it will

once it's got the latest over-the-air

software update

now you do get

two zone climate control which is

adjusted on the screen down here which

normally

i would moan about but it's actually

really clear and easy to use so i'm

willing to forgive the lack of physical

dials now i know obviously the portrait

screen is very much associated with a

tesla

Polestar knew that and they thought we

better make sure that ours is up to

scratch and you know what

it is anything else worth mentioning

well we've got a 12.3 inch digital dial

cluster here we've got a 360 degree

camera wireless phone charging a very

nice harman kardon sound system plus the

fact that i could adjust the climate

control before i got in the car and now

i feel all nice and snug

even the entry-level Polestar 2 is very

well equipped with the differences in

price between the three models being

mainly down to the different battery and

electric motors in each the two single

motor models are front wheel drive and

have 221 and 228 brake horsepower

whereas our dual motor model is

four-wheel drive and has 402 brake

horsepower all three versions of the car

can be charged at a maximum speed of 150

kilowatts for a not to 80 charge in less

than 40 minutes

led lights heated seats a powered boot

lid and 19-inch alloy wheels are all as

standard as you'd expect from a brand

owned by volvo the Polestar 2 also comes

loaded with the latest safety tech there

are optional packs that bundle features

together plus extras like a tow bar

should you want one

go to our Polestar 2 review on the

website for the full details

it's very nice here in the back as well

now this car has the optional

performance pack which means

you get the dead glamorous gold seat

belts plus panoramic sunroof which

actually

makes it feel really airy back here i

mean i'm five foot six i've got loads of

headroom loads of leg room i mean it's

not quite as spacious as a model three

but it's not far off you've got two

isofix points here and here as well as

one in the front seat as well a couple

of air vents a couple of usbc ports

heated seats for a nice little warm tush

where the polestar does make up ground

on the model 3 in the practicality

department is when it comes to the boot

the Polestar has a total capacity of

440 liters if you add the frunk that's

the compartment underneath the bonnet to

the boot whereas the model 3 has 425

liters

in either car you'll probably want to

use the frunk for the charging cables or

the odd bag of shopping but the pole

star has the edge in another way it has

a hatchback rather than a saloon

tailgate so it's much easier to load

fold the 60 40 rear folding seats down

and you've got

1095 liters to play with

a lot of the first electric cars weren't

capable of towing but polestar offers

the optional tow bar for a thousand

pounds the car can manage a maximum

towing capacity of 1 500 kilograms or

750 kilograms for an unbreak trailer

so now that the sensible bit is out of

the way i think it's about time i told

you how good this car is to drive so the

402 brake horsepower dual motor version

gets this car from not to 62 in 4.5

seconds so yeah it's got that instant

hit of power that we've got used to in

the quickest electric cars not only that

but the four-wheel drive means it feels

really nice and secure and balanced when

you floor the accelerator which is um

totally what i've been doing i'm just

gonna do it one more time now because i

can oh good fun

what's more impressive than straight

line speed is how well it handles

because okay yeah it doesn't quite match

the most powerful model 3 in terms of

the not 260 time but on twisty turny

rhodes it is just as fun it's all thanks

to the low

center of gravity and the 50 50 weight

distribution means that when you're

taking corners

everything just feels really nicely

balanced

i mean the steering

doesn't have as much feel as a bmw 3

series but it does tell you more about

what the front wheels are doing than a

model 3.

the key items in the performance pack i

mentioned earlier are olin's dampers

more powerful brembo brakes and 20-inch

forged alloy wheels the dampers improve

body control in corners while the brakes

and wheels add to the car's aGeelyty

gold tire valve caps are also included

in the pack but they only make the car

look quicker

and when you're not driving the car

quickly the upgraded dampers do make the

suspension feel

quite firm i think especially with the

combination of having the bigger alloy

wheels that we've got here what is very

nice is that you can adjust them

yourself you can make them slightly more

forgiving if you want or make them

firmer if you want that as well but the

fact that you have to jack up the car to

do the back ones means i don't think

many people are gonna bother

now this car has three levels of

regenerative braking if you class off

as one of the levels which i am

and the most powerful one is called

standard now when you're using it

driving around town it just means that

you don't actually have to touch the

brake

you can just ride the accelerator

and pull your foot off

and you'll just come to a complete

standstill once you get used to it it

makes it really really relaxing to drive

actually and puts charge back into the

battery

now even on these big wheels

the car is really really quiet

i mean on the standard suspension and on

the smaller wheels it will make it a lot

more refined but overall

it's very comfortable and quiet and

relaxing when you want it to be but also

it is jolly good fun when you want it to

be as well

win-win

okay all important deal makers and deal

breakers incoming

the Polestar 2 has a smart modern

stylish interior and build quality feels

excellent as well

the 11.1 inch touchscreen isn't the

biggest on the market but the graphics

are great and the android system makes

it really easy to use

the car is fun to drive and the

range-topping dual motor model is

seriously

quick

the ride can feel firm sometimes

especially with the dampers and wheels

included in the performance pack

the Polestar 2 is an excellent electric

family car and a very good alternative

from one that i've probably mentioned

quite a few times the tesla model 3 i

mean okay not quite as fast doesn't

quite have the same maximum range but

interior infotainment build quality

practicality and all a match and it puts

a lovely smile on your face on a twisty

turny road so

if you're on the market for an upmarket

electric family hatchback

this is a very stylish contender that is

well worth considering
