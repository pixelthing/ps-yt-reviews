this video was brought to you by

stoneburg about the real planner mr

green ken power and marcus bill

yo what's up we are now at soccer k food

set and behind me here you see Polestar

2 this is called the single motor stand

and range so that's slightly smaller

battery and his front wheel drive so

hopefully it's more efficient and we're

going to do 1000 kilometer challenge

because i want to know

you pay a lower price for this car and

how fast is it for a proper long trip

so um

i actually haven't done the range test

yet so i don't know exactly how much we

have but we have 64 kilowatt hour there

so i guess maybe right under 60

well actually we will find out maybe

about 60 kilowatt hour net capacity

so

it looks just like the the regular well

the the bigger more expensive Polestar

it has the awesome lights

it has the Polestar up there

so we've been charged now to 97

wait i mean oh yeah yeah new update

now the Polestar 2 will pre-heat the

battery before arriving at the fast

charger we navigate to and we'll also

show you how fast you're charging thumbs

up to polestar for updating the cars

so we're going to start exactly at 11

tonight

i'm doing this to avoid too much rain if

we start tomorrow there'll be some

massive rain on the south so there's

yeah

so i actually don't know where we'll

stop yet but most likely it would be

strum style

wait can we just say hey google

navigate to circle k

okay

navigating to southern street no hey

google

what

navigate to ionitis drumstone

navigating to ionic systems

okay okay okay all right all right all

right

let's just find it manually instead it's

uh

somewhere around here

okay i'll find it i'll find it

we've been driving for uh well i don't

know how long but 54 kilometers so far

and you see we're down to

79 percent

consumption is remarkably low 199

wattage i heard that they've done some

updates

um

you see if you go here

uh there's a ranger system this is the

latest version worse than 1.7 and

supposedly if you turn on equal climate

the car will do some heat scavenging to

try to save energy

and then as a compensation it might be a

little bit colder so just have it warm

enough 21 i might have to crank it to

22. we'll see but it should be good we

should be

saving energy now and also this single

motor should be more efficient so right

now the car estimates that we can make

it

over

specular specular specular specular

specular

with seven percent that would be amazing

if you can make it there because

even the

even the kia ev6 which has a bigger

battery

was kind of struggling together it made

it there

barely if i remember correctly so

let's see if the Polestar 2 can make it

there

okay we're going to do a little distance

check here at the schweinsten

so uh usually when i come here we're

supposed to have 114 kilometers you see

it's right there

right about there and you can see here

that

[Music]

yeah it is 114

100 yeah so this is oh freaking it's

auto steer man yeah so that means that

we have swedish precision yeah

so we can do 99. oh that's good

so

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

we are now charging at hobby we came

here with about 20 percent a little bit

here you see the stats so far

oh not too bad 230 consumption okay but

look

the car now shows charging speed and

we're getting 116 kilowatt that's not

too bad

yeah uh okay we're supposed to get this

until 40 percent let's see okay but my

next stop

uh since i'm stopped here then i don't

have to stop at the wait

why does it look so weird now i don't

have to stop but um at speculate

speculates back in this particular so

i'm going to go straight to var valley

wait how do we

oh uh huh okay wait how

is this overview okay okay okay that's

weird i'm not used to this sorry

i look like a noob so because if you

want to zoom out you want to see an

overview i can do this i guess

yeah you see but then you don't see any

information about the route so you have

to re-center and then you see that it's

166 kilometer and we can't make it there

yet but we'll chart for a little bit

this is the first time i'm here i always

hammer past this spot

you see e6 is right there

so there is a little bit of

detour to get here

uh actually around two minutes so not

right by the highway but at least over

here we have four eon chargers so there

is a high chance that there will be

available when you get here i think

maybe

people tend to go to ionity instead so

maybe in the future i will stop here

more often

so we have gas station over there open

24 7 uh

and we'll just

camp it for a bit i guess

we've been charging for 20 minutes

we're getting close to 70 percent

uh it went fast until 40 percent we got

over 100 voicing 100 almost 120 kilowatt

then it starts stepping down to 95

kilowatt and now we're down to 62

kilowatts but i calculated that we have

around 65 no no wait

we have around

56.5 kilowatt hour only

um

and that based on that one i calculated

i need 65 percent to reach viable

65 i also checked against a better

planner i bet the replanner claims that

i need 61

so that means i'm more confident on my

calculation of 65

so if we go

yeah and then and then this car

i guess google then estimate will buy

with 3 percent

so let's just go for

70

in about a couple of minutes and then we

should be fine we have a little margin

also

but this means over 20 minute charting

stop here

[Music]

three two one

[Music]

we have passed gothenburg now and

yes i'm down to 14

it's kind of 13

going kind of deep but i should i think

we should be fine i'm i'm confident we

can make it there because the car now

tells me

i will arrive at two percent but you see

i'm going to show you something weird

here

okay we're going to be two percent in 31

kilometer if you click here you will

then see the the route overview and

stuff

here the car says we will arrive at one

percent

inconsistency for the win

look at that two percent

one percent well well well

oh



this is freaking scary

we are in the 110 zone the car told me i

would have one percent at why back i

have one percent now

we are not a driver yet we are 2.4

kilometers away from waterbag i was

trusting the navigation

next time don't trust the navigation i

had to slow down now i turn off hvac

we're almost there though but

the the power limit appeared for a

little bit and then it disappeared

so i don't want to take any risk so we

just slow down a bit we lose a little

bit of uh

i i calculated already we must have lost

around two minutes so i guess no big

deal there go right back oh stop

there

we made it here lou i look like hulk oh

me mad at fossil oh i'm okay we're here

at ion divide

so

oh man

um

for some reason we're not getting the

maximum speed yet but i think it's

because the voltage is too low

but this is fine okay we are riding on

the 100 plus kilowatt wave so um

yes now we're gonna check it out oh the

screen went off

do you want to lo what

okay

stuff like this

annoys me we are charging the car should

know that we are charging

why is it bugging the user that we

should find a charging station this is

bad

bad user experience

[Music]

no you don't want to find the charging

station we already charging here

okay anyway

uh the next stop i want to try

navigation now so we're going to try

this okay let me see the road order all

right let me adjust a bit okay

hey google

navigate to ionity

i can't find driving directions to your

destination

hey

google navigate to ionity

i can't find driving directions to your

destination okay whatever i'll keep it

okay

i only you see we see spec no no no no i

unity

uh

it's called uh helsingborg

oh it found it

noise

yeah you see it detects it as a very

fast charger which means that when we go

there it will pre-heat the the aku

before okay good

right but now it will tell me that i

won't make it there but that's fine i'm

just going to sit and wait a bit

dude stop bugging me about this thing no

nine

okay we could be good

we've been charging for over 30 minutes

and now suddenly okay it was at 60

kilowatts for the longest time now it

dropped to 50 kilowatt this is the time

for us to leave now all right but it did

pay off to to ride on the 60 kilowatt

wave because uh

actually right now i don't know how much

we'll drive it we'll see um

let's go for 75 and there we go

wow we are now on the concrete surface

near falconback you can see the wind

turbines to the left and right remember

remember these are wind turbines not

windmills

windmills is the grind

wind turbines are for generating

electricity

but you can hear how noisy it is

because

i always pointed this out before that

the Polestar 2 has good

wind noise protection but road noise is

actually kind of bad and this surface

here

really proves how

bad the road the noise part is compared

to for example uh

knee or es-8 this this surface here is

the concrete surface

and usually it's loud and uncomfortable

but

the air suspension here just floats over

this road

like like butter it's just

silky smooth

or actually even the

the kia ev6 wasn't that noisy over here

we are now

climbing up the holland social and

you know i charge to 76 percent

we are down to 25 now

and in the beginning with the left the

ion the charger the car estimated that

i would arrive

with 18 percent

and now the car says i will run with

five percent so i figure that out after

three legs now

uh the this car will estimate how much

you need based on that you drive exactly

at the speed limit

tesla however was like this in the

beginning but that this last been

evolving so tesla will then

figure out how fast you are actually

driving

and then it will estimate and give you a

better estimation even the eqc i tried

also gave a damn good estimation

even was i was hammering a little bit so

um i think this is uh it has some room

for improvement for uh polestar

to uh yeah

yeah yeah okay

we are now at the endpoint housing

boiling we came here with two percent

left

ninja calculation by me

always

um we have to deduct three minutes total

now two minutes because of the traffic

but i started charging now but then by

mistake

the cable here

bumped into the unlock cable button here

i pointed out this before that it's

really easy if you yeah you know i'm

just gonna show you now what you could

do is that if you do something like this

and you accidentally press that button

with your knock or something oh let's

not stay there

if you just accident press that button

you will stop charging where he go now

here you will stop charging

so

yeah okay it was my mistake you can say

no it's the car's fault well but okay i

let it be my mistake so we deduct three

minutes

uh at least now we are getting 110

kilowatts so i charge you 76 percent and

i so i spend 74 getting here which means

i need

more because in the return we have

slight headwind so i need almost 80

no

don't tell me that i have low range when

i'm charging stop it

we've been charging for almost half an

hour

this has been

every time now when we charge today we

charge for half an hour

so um

yeah

i guess that's the name of the game we

are almost good to go i need around 75

76 maybe and then it starts throttling

now so yeah we shouldn't stay here too

long

so

over here by the way

this gas station is open but

this is not luca which means i'm going

to show you i can zoom in i think you

can see it

not

luca the the doors are closed but you

can go just like in germany you have to

order from the oh from the window

somewhere

so

but i'm almost good to go anyway i'm

gonna go to wild bag if i want to get

some food

[Music]

[Music]

we are back at

ionity

wild bike

okay the plan first was that i was going

to charge just enough to go to speculate

back in the specular but then

i had a bad stomach

and i had to go to the restroom but then

i kept charging so now what we're going

to do is we're going to skip that one

and go back to hobie the place which is

charged at the first stop and i

calculate okay we barely made it here

when we had where is 70 so it means that

now okay i'm charged a little bit more

and then we can go there with full speed

so again half an hour stop here okay

whatever we skip charges which is also

good because we then cut down on

overhead because it actually takes some

time to exit the highway get over here

and then plug it in and handshake and

yeah look at that ass

[Music]

we on our charging up this is second to

last journey top we came here with eight

percent

so at this time i don't have to stay

here too long because

the next stop will be the last stop

which is at venusen's pushkin we have

photon charges over there

um

yeah only 84 kilometers and then we jump

another 120 back home

so i'm going to show you now uh

these are abb charger now you see in the

daylight what it looks like

the noisy abb charges with some

noisy fans here

what the heck is wrong here nice nothing

is wrong

so

it's co-financed by the european union

yeah duncan

but i guess in order to get

support like this

they have to be open for everyone so

that's why tesla superchargers cannot

get funding from eu

so yeah

now we just wait um not too long i think

i'm going to the restroom and that's it

i only have time for a quick rest and

break over here

we have rasta restaurant but um maybe

next time we'll see next time and also i

can show that

okay you see this place is called

you can see in the on the

logo there let me show you that

zoom in

swedes they call it

um not ok q8 but

the q otta supposedly means ku

it's like a slang for kuwait

which is where the oil comes from

i think that's how it is some swedes can

explain to me yeah so that's that's why

that they call it

normally i go to circle k but now i go

to kugota

wow this is kind of weird

because normally when i pass through

here it would be night and i don't see

sheet but today i actually see some

landscape

but okay so

uh

we have now done uh

what this is so weird i just topped up

to 52 number 51 percent and we are

already down to 38

the percentage goes down really quick so

as always i have the passport ready

for the border control

and here we have the wind turbines again

noise

not windmills wind turbines

we are now charging at switzerland

spokane but for some reason i'm not

getting 120 kilowatt it's only 99.

this charger is supposed to be

yeah it's supposed to be 150 kilowatts

but i like this i just learned that we

have one high power charger here there

is plenty of charges over there

but this you see you see this roundabout

when i did 1000km challenge in the

norway route i would drive here and then

turn back and go

that way when the right where the white

car went

so this is actually pretty cool that we

have a we have a pit stop right here

but okay um i check now

the average speed up until this point is

90 kilometers per hour which means that

with this charting stop we might be able

to do it within 11 and a half hour which

is that we can match the old time of the

bigger battery but of course once we

test the bigger battery they have

increased the charging speed so the

bigger battery will be faster but that

means that this car will actually get a

good time

amazing right but based on the

consumption now it also seems like the

front wheel drive

according to my calculation is around 20

to 30 watt hour per kilometer more

efficient

yeah

but okay so now a quick pit top

and then i go to the gas station

and grab some food and go to the

restroom

i think we have to deduct one minute

because

i had to restart the charging

because the charge limit

i accidentally set chart limit to 40

percent

and then it reached it and then it this

and then stopped because

it's i'm gonna show you now again

i keep

just just but well

like by accident you see you see how

easy

you can easily change charging i almost

don't touch it and you you change charge

limit in tesla for example you have to

enter a screen in order to change charge

limit

here it's just so easy to accidentally

set it and i set it to 40 percent

so is it the user error or is it uh

a car error i don't know but i'm going

to deduct one minute so we have now

seven minutes total

we are on the move again the last run so

we are now at well american show here is

more detail

we're not 918 kilometers

but the time is what is time now do we

have clock there no we don't have clock

there okay we're clocking 9 41.

so uh we have to talk seven minutes so

yeah okay we're getting close to the 11

hour mark but we still have to drive

another 80 kilometers so

right it's uh saturday morning so we

shouldn't have too much traffic going

into oslo now

we have to do the countdown

991

992

9993

994

995

996

997

1022 that means

11 15.

11 15.

all right all right

we are back in oslona so yes this was

awesome you know

i set my expectation kind of low because

i knew this car had

smaller battery so i was thinking

faster than 12 hours would be great well

we did it in 11 hours and 15 minutes

which is actually faster than previous

Polestar 2 with a bigger battery but

why was the Polestar 2 back then slower

well

from what i remember it cold gate a

little bit which means that it didn't

charge that fast initially until the

battery heated up so uh and what else

was it yeah the charging curve might not

be the best and also

the consumption was a bit high with that

pulse star

but

with this car now it has a latest update

um the 1.7

version uh and with that one supposedly

poster claims that they have now

preheating before fast charging as long

as you navigate to a fast charger i did

that

today

every time and also so i didn't call

that a lot you guys saw it was instant

fast every time and also they improved

the charting curve even on this small

battery that came up later and they have

claimed to also improve the efficiency

something about i don't know the motors

or something uh inverter logic i don't

know but those three things together

actually make this car faster than the

old polestar but i'm not done there

because i'm going to test the the the

what they all i mean i'm going to test

the dual motor long range

in just two days now i will pick it up

and i will also run some tests some i

will do

consumption test i don't have to measure

the battery because i think that's the

same battery capacity and i will also

check again charting speed because they

have improved it

so yes uh but if you look at the table

now and compare

against other cars in the same what the

car likes to all the time

compared against other cars okay i tried

to compare against cars in the same

price range and you see that actually

the made in china model 3

standard range plus

was faster yeah efficiency is king

but again not everyone wants a tesla i

spoke to a guy before i did one thousand

kilometer challenge tonight and he said

that he was happy that he saw my video

and he bought a Polestar too and he

liked the looks of it and he didn't like

the looks of tesla fair enough but um

okay and then

uh other cars maybe the eqa but ek was

remarkably fast it was efficient okay it

was summer yeah that's true but 1020

that is the eq was joining like a bus

and it was fairly efficient okay fair

enough about that one what about but

then nah maybe eq is not too fair it's

it's like an suv crossover area but id3

is fair comparison 10 45 all right it

was summer consumption was quite good on

the on the id3

um

so yeah this one is half an hour slower

but i guess in summer we could be maybe

down to 11 hours that's pretty close to

the id3

uh what else is it that we can compare

against um

well yeah well i think that's it really

pretty much yeah kona kona we were

faster than kona oh

11 30 for kona yeah

it was a little bit cold for the for the

corner also similar temperature actually

for for me but corner was more efficient

but corner charged slower so i think the

downside with this Polestar is that

okay it seems to be more efficient than

the dual motor polestar but

it's not really there with it with tesla

and the korean really classic korean

cars at least when it comes to

efficiency so i would love to see it

maybe even more efficient to be closer

to eqa or

ix3 which are

just front wheel drive or rail drive not

all wheel drive

but other than that though

comfortable car it has a

things like few bugs or whatever that i

don't like with the software that can be

fixed as for the

interior nice seats feels a bit sweaty

good side support in the seats um i feel

like it's a bit hard for me i prefer

slightly softer seats but that's my

taste center control i always thought it

it still is a bit cramped i prefer

having it more open like maybe cars or

tesla or

the korean cars also like iev6 but you

know that's just me but overall i would

say that

even though the infotainment has a

little bit of quirks and here and there

the infotainment system is still better

than most other cars i've tried

but it can be improved even further so

anyway i think that's going to be it for

now i hope you guys enjoyed this video

as always thank you for watching and

talk to you later
