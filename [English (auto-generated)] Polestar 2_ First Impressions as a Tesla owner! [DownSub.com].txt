this video is sponsored by evie wash so

let's talk polstar if you didn't know

polstar is actually a subsidiary of the

geely group a chinese automotive company

they produce cars under brands like

lotus and volvo polstar was actually

originally a racing group acquired by

volvo in 2015 and then in 2017 it was

announced that they would be producing

electric performance cars underneath the

polestar brand they started with the

polestar one a plug-in hybrid ev in 2017

and then added the Polestar 2 in 2019

which is a fully electric model it's

been slow to roll out in the us so far

however they did deliver 29 000 vehicles

in 2021 and i got a chance to check one

out in pasadena towards the end of last

year this was actually a rental through

enterprise that myself and brandon and

tyler over that the everyday ev channel

split during our weekend in pasadena and

full disclosure enterprise did not

assist us financially at all with this

car we paid out of pocket like we would

any other rental we were fortunate to

have this car for the full weekend

friday through monday when we returned

the car so definitely a lot longer than

other videos i make about cars i get to

test drive so here are my first

impressions after a few days with the

Polestar 2. first off this is the long

range dual motor all-wheel drive trim in

the moon paint color it's kind of this

grayish color with some brown tints in

it that look really nice this car was

essentially fully loaded with options

including the performance pack which

adds some features like the olin's dual

flow valve shock absorbers gold brembo

four piston aluminum front calipers

20 inch 4y spoke polished forged alloy

wheels with gold valve caps and high

gloss black roof segment the spec sheet

shows an epa estimated range of 249

miles and 0 to 60 in four and a half

seconds interestingly enough the

performance pack upgrade actually

doesn't add any actual performance just

kind of adds some of those improved

parts on the vehicle so there's no zero

to sixty time difference between the

normal all-wheel drive and the

performance pack all-wheel drive pulstar

does also sell a rear wheel drive

version of the Polestar 2 and that raises

the 0-60 time to around 7 seconds so you

sacrifice some performance there but

does bump the range up to around 270

miles but before we dive deeper into how

this car drives and the overall

performance let's talk about this

exterior design and right off the bat

you'll probably notice that big front

grille and personally i'm a big fan of

this which is probably weird to hear me

say if you've been following this

channel for a while but i think polestar

has pulled off one of the few faux

grilles that i really like in evs

generally i think they're really awkward

and look out of place but i think this

really fits with this car design and

overall i think they've kept a lot of

the traditional exterior features that

make their volvo vehicles look nice and

they've upgraded a few to kind of

achieve this more futuristic design i

think those 4y spoke wheels are easily

the best looking rim offerings so i'm

glad we got a chance to see those in

person with that upgraded performance

pack and all those gold accents really

fit with the vehicle especially on this

moon paint color as for lights polestar

has kept things pretty traditional on

the headlights they look very similar to

a lot of the other volvo headlights but

this does include pixel technology that

can help shade oncoming cars so you're

not blinding them with your headlights

definitely neat feature i think we'll

see in a lot of new evs coming out this

year on the rear you can see they're

definitely leaning into this light bar

design that's become quite popular with

a lot of new evs especially on the tail

lights and there's also some cool

animations they do with this so i'm a

big fan of this look overall couple

other things to note on the exterior the

charge port is located on the rear

driver side panel and this is a manual

release the Polestar 2 can handle dc

charging up to 155 kilowatts and their

spec sheet quotes around 33 minutes to

charge from 10 to 80 percent personally

i think 150 kw for dc charging is the

absolute minimum any new car should be

coming out with nowadays i do wish they

kind of future-proofed it and bumped

this up a little bit but i think 155

kilowatts is definitely gonna meet your

needs for any kind of driving or

charging you're going to be doing on the

road right now the side view mirrors are

also frameless which is kind of an odd

thing to see in person and you'll notice

when you adjust them the entire mirror

housing moves not just the mirror inside

which is a little bit different than

what you're probably used to up front

there is a small frunk area i'd say it's

comparable maybe a little bit smaller

than i'm used to in my model 3 and this

is a good place to store some charging

cables like as shown here if we move to

the rear the trunk release is in a weird

spot right above the license plate so

that took a day or two to remember where

to press to actually open the trunk and

it does have this hatchback style design

so easy to get things in and out and

obviously plenty of room for all the

camera gear we brought for this trip to

pasadena before we move on to the

interior let's talk about today's video

sponsor

evie wash not only is evie wash a great

detailing product but they're also good

for the planet which is a big reason i

love them so these products are 100

biodegradable they're also reducing a

lot of single-use plastic waste that can

come with washing your car so

these bottles if you can hear this put

it down by the mic here these are

actually aluminum they are not those

cheap plastic bottles that you see a lot

of other products come in so they are

reusable and when it's time to refill

them you fill them up with these refills

right here that come in a paper bag that

is also recyclable and biodegradable and

they actually plant one tree for every

bottle or refill sold so definitely

check out evwash and if you want to get

a discount you can use my code alex 30

for 30 off your purchase now let's get

back to the video and that brings us

into the interior although the car does

seem very good size on the exterior is

actually a little bit surprised at how

small it felt on the interior i'm very

familiar with the tesla vehicles so this

felt like it split the difference

between the model 3 and the model y in

terms of interior space i fit a bit

better in the back seat than i would in

my model 3 but there wasn't

significantly more space like i was

expecting but overall feel and materials

wise this was quite comfortable the

interior has this weave tech seat

material actually which is kind of a

wetsuit-esque feel i'd imagine it cleans

really easily as well so that is nice

and of course this is the performance

pack so you've got those gold accents

that continue all the way onto the seat

belts which i think is a nice touch

materials overall i thought were just

really well done i think the interior

feels very premium they've got this mix

of leather and fabric that really just

fits with the car and that brings us to

the touchscreen which i think was the

smartest move by polestar across the

entire car

instead of trying to develop something

in-house pulstar collaborated with

google to create android automotive os

and this is not to be confused with

android auto but it does have a lot of

the same features so in this android

automotive os the car is actually

running its own operating system so you

can download apps directly the car

versus android auto where you're kind of

mirroring what your phone has installed

on it i spent a few minutes clicking

through this display and i can tell you

that it is responsive very well laid out

has a lot of features that you would

expect in a new car in 2022 i think

probably the biggest thing here is that

it's got google maps built in with ev

route planning so if you are plugging it

in a destination it will take your state

of charge into account and also plan out

charging stops along the way for you

definitely a smart move and i wish more

vehicles started to include this because

that's a big feature i like on my tesla

i don't have to think about route

planning a lot of the time because the

car does a lot of the work and overall i

think this is a smart move by polestar

to go with this android automotive os

versus depending on android auto or car

play or something like that i know when

i hop in the car i like the car to have

everything it needs to drive i don't

want to depend on my phone to open up

certain apps and run certain things the

Polestar 2 also has a dashboard screen

which i actually really like coming from

the model 3 where this is absent this

has a lot of vital information like

navigation speed light status and state

of charge that are all really nice to

have in front of you versus trying to

tilt your head to the side to see and

outside of those touchscreen controls i

think pulstar really struck a good

balance between software controls and

physical controls things like

temperature controlled on the touch

screen but the actual vents are physical

adjusting things like the mirrors and

windows are in the normal spot

and i think the center console is well

designed as well i especially love this

shifter i think it really fits in with

the overall angular design language and

you've even got physical controls for

music that are available right in front

of that but probably the weirdest quirk

on the interior is the cup holder so

instead of dual cup holders you've

actually got one in the middle here and

if you open up this center console rest

right here you'll find the second cup

holder which is just a really odd design

choice i'm not sure why they decided to

stick a cup holder inside of there

instead of trying to fit dual cup

holders in a normal spot but let's get

into driving now and overall i was very

impressed like i was with the rest of

the vehicle

everything i expected from the pulstar

is what i got when i drove it it is the

all-wheel drive trim zero to sixty and

four and a half seconds so plenty of

torque there and felt very comparable to

my model 3 in terms of performance and

more than enough acceleration for just

day-to-day driving steering felt really

nice as well and it is adjustable so you

can make it either more comfortable or

more sporty depending on what your

preferences are probably the biggest

thing i would change is the performance

pack actually i don't think i would

quite spring for that upgrade unless i

really wanted to track the car or just

had the money to blow on upgrading the

car the suspension was just a little bit

too stiff and you definitely notice it

when you're going around curbs and just

driving in the city where things aren't

as smooth as they are on the highway as

for self-driving or autonomous features

pulstar is using pilot assist which is

the same system from their volvo

vehicles it is very similar to tesla's

basic autopilot so you've got kind of

your lane keep assist and adaptive

cruise control however i did find this

to be not great on curves so it would

bump it out of this pilot assist and not

stay in my lane as straight as i would

want it so i think autopilot still has

the edge there one thing we did notice

towards the end of the weekend is the

suspension actually started squeaking a

lot anytime we hit a bump we could hear

the suspension squeaking and kind of

bouncing up and down

and we're not sure if this was the

performance pack upgrade and that

different suspension that was causing

that

but there's also a way to adjust that

suspension so we're thinking maybe a

previous renter had tried to adjust that

suspension it's not done through the

touchscreen it's actually a physical

adjustment so if anybody messed with

that it could have thrown off the

balance and caused that squeaking to

occur but overall i'm a big fan of the

polestar i really like the minimalist

interior really like the design of the

exterior as well i think charging speeds

are good i think just overall it's a

solid car and i'm glad they went with

that google os to

power the touchscreen and just power the

software in the car they do have

over-the-air updates that are rolling

out fairly frequently so that is a good

sign and there's also a federal tax

credit still available for the pulstar

so definitely a good one to check out i

think the range could be a little bit

better but if you don't need a full 300

miles and you're good with 250 to 270

this is definitely a good one to check

out so definitely one to keep on your

list if you're looking to buy a new ev

in 2022 but that is my first impressions

let me know what you thought down in the

comments below and if i miss anything

here or want to give your feedback

definitely let me know as well thanks so

much for watching and i will see you in

the next video
