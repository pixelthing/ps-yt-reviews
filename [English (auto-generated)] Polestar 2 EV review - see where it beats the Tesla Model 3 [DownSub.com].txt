this is the new Polestar 2 electric car

and it's a little bit like a samsung

galaxy s10 mobile phone in the way that

the design is cooler

than the obvious iphone choice i mean

look it's got a curved screen look at

that it's like

[Music]

i believe i just kissed my mobile phone

anyway the obvious choice for this size

of electric car is of course the tesla

model 3. so in this video

i'm going to see how this new Polestart

measures up to the tesla i'm going to

take it for a drive

check out his performance three two one

launch

try its technology hey google driver's

seat

heating sorry i don't understand

oh this is really do my head in test its

range

look i use a lot of energy then by

suddenly accelerating show you all

around the cabin i like it a lot

see how practical it is that's really

useful and do some other tests with it

as well

now if you're thinking about buying a

new car if you click on the pop-out

alternatively if you just want to do

things the old-fashioned way you can

just google car wow and go to our

website

anyway let's get on with the review

let's start this video by talking about

the design because you might be looking

at this Polestar 2

thinking wait a minute that's a bit

familiar looks a bit like a volvo

now there's a reason for that you see

Polestar was

volvo's performance arm a bit like amg

is to mercedes

but the whole company was bought by Geely

a chinese car giants which

also owns lotus and a load of other

brands as well and they've put Polestar

as its own brand focusing on electric

cars

so the first one was the 140 000 pounds

Polestar one plug-in hybrid

this is their second one hence the name

Polestar two now the guy who's in

charge of Polestar

used to be in charge of the design of

cars a volvo and that's why this car

looks rather

like a volvo in fact it's based on a

volvo concept that's why it's got a

grill it doesn't need a grill it's an

electric car there's no engine

there in fact this panel in future will

be used for housing all the sensors and

stuff

it's got radar camera in it already but

going down the line

Polestars will still have a grill but

they will be used more for centering

rather than

air you've got fake vents on it but it

does look good doesn't it and you can

tell the headlights

the way they got the thor hammer effect

that is very very volvo

now moving down the side as standard the

car gets 19-inch alloy wheels

these are the upgraded 20s and they do

look pretty badass

the car itself is actually based on the

xc40 platform that's why it's quite high

look it's quite a tall car

it's taller than a tesla model 3. there

is one thing i've spotted that i'm not

sure about there's like a sticker here

with the car's name on it and the

battery capacity and stuff like that

i'll probably be peeling that off i like

this bit though this crease

then it comes round the back the best

bit of this guy look at the back of this

this light is so cool in fact i think

the design of this car is really going

to help sell it

so i've said to various people who've

been looking for an electric car get a

tesla model 3. they're awesome

only for them to come back to me going

now the model 3 looks like a fish or

it looks like it's melting or it just

looks boring let's put them off the car

i think they would like this car they'll

be in the market for it it is

definitely better looking let's see what

it's like on the inside

oh yes oh yes

i'm definitely liking this it's

minimalist but not in the same way

that a tesla is so minimalist it's like

an unfurnished flat this is like

a coolly minimalist butt furnished

scandinavian flat it's great and the

materials

lovely soft expensive feeling

only as you get lower down do they get a

bit scratchy

but overall the quality does feel a bit

better than in the tesla model 3.

i really like the way that the pod style

logo is reflected up in the roof

i love the design of this gear selector

as well all very simple

and the metalist door handles steering

wheels good as well

though it's familiar it may have a pole

star badge on it but

it could quite easily have a volvo one

because it come from volvo

as has the switch gear that's not really

a complaint is it it's not like oh no

the steering wheel and the controls are

from volvo that's such a cheap brand

i like it a lot best bit though this

infotainment screen

so nice clear portrait infotainment

screen but the best thing about it

is that it's actually android it's not

done by volvo

it's done by the people who know how to

do user interfaces and software it's

brilliant it's got all that you need

it's so easy to navigate between

and of course being android your maps

for google maps

there's no need to connect your phone to

it and run android auto it's absolutely

epic

and it's so easy to scroll through the

different menus and

choose the layout exactly how you want

it plus you can sign in with your google

account

so it'll remember your preferences and

stuff like that you've got spotify

as well you've got all that you need you

have a home button

you have all your climate controls there

so they're always on the screen if you

need them

this for me is the best infotainment

system

in any car right now you also get a

digital driver's display

and that is epic too because that can

run google maps

so it's just really clear you can cycle

through a couple of views

and it shows things like your charging

your range and all that kind of stuff

the only downside is is that the mapping

is a bit dark but i know why they've

done that

because if it's brightly coloured it can

be a bit more distracting when you're

driving

still i would like the option now

there's one more benefit about it being

part of google as well is that you get

google assistant voice commands so i can

just go

hey google take me to london

sorry i don't understand let me try

again

hey google navigate me to london

navigating to london you have to find

the right words but you can also use it

to control various functions inside the

car such as

hey google put the seat heating on sorry

i don't understand hey google driver's

seat

heating sorry i don't understand

oh this is really do my head in hey

google

set temperature too low got it

changing the temperature to low okay

so it's not infallible but google

assistant generally is pretty good

honest all the apple fanboys okay it's

nowhere near as good as siri

no you just proved that point so yeah

anyway

with this car you get three-year

subscription to the internet

through google which is good and other

standard kit

includes the glass roof you have led

matrix headlights so they'll blank out

part of their beam so you don't dazzle

on coming drivers

you've got a harman kardon stereo with

600 watts got 13 speakers the speaker

here doesn't have the harman kardon logo

on it instead they're giving it a little

badge here at the request

of polstar don't know why they've done

that just i guess a bit more

minimalist a bit more swedish other

stuff that you get

includes wireless charging for your

mobile phone so you don't need to plug

it in at all

obviously and electrically heated

and operated seats they're lovely seats

actually

and they're covered in vegan friendly

materials though you can pay extra for

leather

if you want to kill some animals it's up

to you in terms of the seating position

itself

you see it higher than you might imagine

once again that's the relationship to

the xc40

but it's easy to find a nice driving

position and there's plenty of

adjustment in the steering wheel as well

look at that it's all good

it's quite a practical car here on the

inside so underneath here

look you can move your arm rest around

look underneath here you have

some cup holders and some hand sanitizer

gel they've provided

for us you also have a cup holder there

though obviously it does then restrict

what you can do with this arm rest the

glove box is

actually an average size so there's a

bit for your manual

and look they give you a handy cleany

cloth for the screen so i can get rid of

my grubby fingerprints

the door bins let's see will they take

why you just decided that i want the

temperature low

hey google turn the fan off

okay turning off fans

it's work that time you're just going to

know the right words that's all

the guy from Polestar is going to be

watching this when i was messing around

with the seat heating because he did a

demonstration for me earlier

made it work perfectly and he'll be like

smacking is there going matt you didn't

say the right words you made us look

stupid

it it does all work fine so shut up

apple fanboys

anyway back to the door bin you can just

about fit a big bottle in there

and look you've got some extra cubbies

just here look at either side you can

put

some stuff in there put the hand

sanitizer in there fairly practical

let's move into the back see what it's

like there i will take my

bottle with me

check out the door bin the first thing

to do which is obviously the most

important thing when you

get into the back of a car and i can

just about squeeze it in there

let's go on to the more important stuff

knee room really really good look at

that

and i can stretch out under the seat in

front

now in some electric cars because the

batteries are

underneath the floor the seat is quite

raised up

and the floor is quite close to the seat

so you end up with your knees almost

running your ears

out like you're in some kind of stress

position however

because this is based on the platform of

the xc40 you have this transmission

tunnel and so they filled that with some

of the batteries which means that the

floor can be a little bit lower so

it's actually quite comfy for under

thigh support

slight problem is headroom look it's

pretty tight

you know i'm 179 centimeters and

i've got that much space so people over

six foot are gonna have to do a little

bit of that old slouching light out

aren't they

but it's all right and you do have an

armrest some cupholders there's a bit

practicality you've got your ice fix

points there as well

and there's also isofix on the front

passenger seat as well so you could

carry through i can't get this back on

that's the job with this thing so

nightmare to get back on come on watson

there we go so that's all good it's also

good that you've got

two usbc charging points there i forgot

to tell you there's two usb ports in the

front as well if you need those

and you've got a couple of buttons there

for your seat heating

and finally some netage there if you

need some netage

so the backs all right not quite as

roomy i don't think as a tesla model 3

but it's still pretty nice to sit back

here

and that roof really does help make it

feel quite airy anyway let's check out

the boot

so you can open it using a button down

there you can open it on the key you can

open it button by the steering wheel or

it comes as standard with

hands-free opening and it's a pretty

reliable one at that

now the amount of space you got there is

pretty decent it's like 405 liters so a

bit less than a tesla model 3

and a bit more than a volkswagen golf

what's good about this compared to the

tesla model 3 is look it's a hatchback

tailgate

so it's just easier to load stuff in

there's a bit of a load

but it's hardly anything so it's easy to

lift things in and

out and there's a lot of nice useful

features here such as some storage nets

there

a little strap there for stuff your 12

volt socket

tie down points hawks and the

interior air brake that you get with

volvos you can see the link to volvos

you get this on things like the xc40

so you can divide up your luggage and

there's a bit more extra space

under here as well that's all included

in your 405 liters to be fair

now you have a ski hatch there so you

can carry longer items and

still two passengers in the back if you

need to carry really big heavy stuff

you can fold the seats down and then you

really feel the benefit of it being a

hatchback because look you've got this

long flat low bed that's really useful

so i'll just shut this now

what's he doing right now one of the

benefits of an electric car is that

there's no engine up front taking up

space so that means

you should have a front boot right and

this sort of does

let me show it to you it's quite big on

a tesla model 3 the front boot

but here on the Polestar 2 not so much

it's only about

35 liters which is space for your

charging cables

and that's it and that brings me on to

five annoying things

about the pulse star team this has to be

the worst car key i have ever seen in my

life it's as though it was a prototype

and someone accidentally signed it off

for a production

you can't give this to a customer

thankfully you will be able to get

the ability to open the car with your

mobile phone and the car will be getting

an over-the-air update

to be able to do that but for now you

have to put up with this rubbish

i often complain about cars where their

rear windows don't go all the way down

turn them out this Polestart as bad as

i've ever seen they go about halfway

down

hardly worth them opening at all now you

might be wondering why i'm demonstrating

that sat in the driver's seat

it's because unless someone is sat in

the driver's seat there's a sensor in it

it won't let the people in the back put

the windows down it's like the ignition

isn't on unless someone's sat in the

seat which is a bit annoying

at the moment you can't get the polestar

2 with apple carplay to

connect your apple phone normally the

other way around you don't have android

auto but you do have apple carplay so

apple fanboys also just to confirm look

the design of the samsung is definitely

cooler than the design of this apple

phone

so there there is no space

to store the load cover underneath the

false floor other than

kind of just doing a lot of that

it's probably not acceptable this is a

fairly heavy car

it weighs 2.1 tonnes by comparison a

tesla model 3

weighs just over 1.8 tons so it's a

difference of 300 kilos which is a lot

the tesla also beats this on another

stat aerodynamics

so this has a drag coefficient of 0.28

cd tesla's is 0.23 cd

the lower the better the more

aerodynamic the more efficient

so this loses out don't worry there's

still plenty to like about this car

here's the car wow five call features

it's like a bit of bass

well this car uses air warfare

technology which incorporates part of

the bulkhead to amplify the base

from the stereo you can get the pulsed

r2 with a performance pack

upgrade and that costs five grand and

for that you get some 20 inch

forged alloy wheels which are

lightweight you also get bigger brakes

including bigger discs

and bigger brake calipers and their

brembo brakes

you also get olin's dampers which are

adjustable

and when i say just you don't press a

button in the cabin you do actually have

to twiddle a knob on the dampers so i

don't think anyone's going to be doing

that

but still it's nice to have oh and look

you get gold little dust covers

for your tar valve smart soon you'll be

able to do an over-the-air update for

the infotainment system

so that it has netflix and youtube which

is really handy if you're charging the

car you can then just watch some videos

our videos you're the kind of person

that likes to pull

trailers well this can tow up to 1500

kilos which is pretty good for an

electric car and you can get it with an

electrically

operated tow hitch as well the door

mirrors

a frameless design like the interior

mirror

so when you move it the whole unit moves

rather than just the

mirror panel inside like on most cars

that is super super

cool even the crow likes it yeah i see

now let's talk about the prize so the

Polestar 2 starts from 49

900 pounds that's important you see it's

100 pounds less

than 50 000 pounds and that means it

qualifies for a 3

000 government grant for evs in the uk

which is great now for that money you

get a 78 kilowatt hour battery

which means that you've got a range

according to Polestar of 292

miles which is about 50 miles less than

you get from a tesla model three long

range

now if you want to charge it from a

three-pin socket it's going to take you

40 hours so you're not going to do that

if you do it from an 11 kilowatt wall

charger it'll take you eight hours

so you can do it overnight if you do a

50 kilowatt dc

charger it'll take about two hours and

if you can find a 150 kilowatt charger

it will do it in 40 minutes

now polstar has teamed up with a company

called plug surfing which gives you

access to loads and loads of chargers

all over the uk and europe with just one

tag so you don't have to join to loads

of different accounts

thing is this is no substitute for

having access to tesla's

excellent supercharger network which

quite frankly no

other electric car has the Polestar 2 has

two electric motors one the front axle

one the rear axle so you've got four

wheel drive

combined they produce 408 horsepower and

660 newton meters of torque

polstar says his car can do not 60 in

4.7

seconds but i'm going to vouch that

myself with my specialist timing gear

up here i'm going to put the car into

esc sports mode

that's the only sport setting really you

can alter the firmness of the steering

but i'll just leave it in standard all i

have to do now is just

plant my right foot and off we go three

two one

launch come on what you're going to do

what are you going to do 4.7 seconds

my ass 4.16 seconds a tesla model 3

performance that'll do not 16

3.2 seconds the long range model 3 will

do it in 4.4 seconds

so that figure there is quicker than the

model 3 long range

one of the great things about electric

cars is the fact that you can drive them

just using the accelerator alone because

when you lift off the accelerator

you get regenerative braking so it's the

motor working reverse slowing the car

down but

recouping energy and putting it back

into the battery so on this car

i can actually alter the amount

of that braking so i can have it off so

just like coast when i lift off which is

what it's doing now i can have it low

so it's not too intrusive but it still

does break quite a lot a bit

more than a normal automatic car would

and then i can put it into standard and

then it really is

pretty intense when you lift off it's

like you're touching the brakes

so you should just be able to drive

without touching the brakes and i'm

going to drive around now

without touching the brake i might crash

into someone hopefully i won't

oh i'm hovering over the brake pedal not

going to use it though

oh collision avoidance came in thought i

was going to crash it i said

in front oh what they doing still not

touching the brake

the person in front is driving like a

bit of a when i see what the

suspension's like i don't know

find some potholes it feels a little bit

on the firm side

it's probably the upgraded suspension

which feels a bit like a downgrade right

now i don't think i'll go for the

performance pack i'll just leave as is

here's a speeder how will it deal with

this this is quite abrupt speed hump so

yeah you do feel it

oh yeah when you drop off that it's not

quite as comfortable over buns

as a tesla model 3. it's not awful i can

live with it

i really do like this display there's

another one there on the instrument

binnacle which shows

what's happening whether you're getting

power from the motor or you're charging

the batteries with the braking there you

can see when i lifted off the

accelerator

that white line just showed that it's

regening the batteries

i wonder if i'll go around this mini

roundabout in one go come on

yes look at that oh i'm gonna make it

yes

the turning circle on this is pretty

good actually this whole one pedal thing

makes driving electric cars just so easy

that's it i had to take the brake then

automatic intervention collision

avoidance

the car was helping me break as well

because it knew i was going to smack

into the car in front

who is that i wonder if it'll be

able to cope with going into that

parking area there it breaks quite

firmly actually look at this look i can

actually get up close and then oh i'm

gonna crush don't crash

i think i was chanting it a little bit

there now it's probably worth just

seeing what this car's like for parking

so you've got a thick pillar here the

view out the back window is pretty awful

it doesn't matter though because i've

got those 360 degree cameras

now it doesn't have the system that you

can get with a tesla where it'll

actually park itself for you

with you outside the car that's all

fancy gimmickry really

not many people use that that's all i

need to be able to park without crashing

so that one pedal thing definitely works

so it's good in town apart from the

suspension's a little bit firm

let's see what it's like on the motorway

hopefully i can do a bit better with the

economy because at the moment

i'm performing pretty badly one of the

settings you can do in this car

is to put creep on so it's like in a

normal automatic so when you lift off

the brake it will just ease forward

but it just sounds weird isn't it being

in creep mode

so what's this car like on the motorway

well it's really good actually

the suspension just smooths out when

you're getting quicker so it's relaxing

the seats are supportive

also it's quite in here don't really

notice the tyre noise

bit of wind noise but that's it really

relaxing to traveling

i can use the piloted assist

cruise control system to basically take

care of absolutely everything

it's going to use radar to keep me a

safe distance from the car in front

and it'll auto steer to keep me in lane

let's set it for 70 miles an hour

see what that does for the economy now

what it won't do

is what the tesla will do and that's

change lanes for you

also i think the system in the tesla is

a bit better at reading the vehicles

around it

whereas this does get a little bit

caught out occasionally but still it

does take the stress

at longer journeys do you like the car

yeah

good car yeah that's the thing the

design does stand out people like the

look in this car

now one of the great things about

electric cars is the instant performance

when you need to suddenly overtake and

i'm going to illustrate that

with this hand sanitizer so i'm going to

floor it to overtake this slow moving

car will that go

into the back seat

it certainly did the pickup is rapid

question is though what's all that done

to my energy usage

look i use a lot of energy then by

suddenly accelerating you can see

that has gone all the way up there it's

very high but overall

it's not so bad

now here's a twisted bit of row let's

see what this Polestar 2 is like

is it sporty feeling the steering's a

little bit on the odd side

it's a quite artificial feeling the one

pedal effect does make it feel like a

go-kart

a little bit and obviously the instant

acceleration

from the electric motor it doesn't lean

much

in the corners at all you got a lot of

grip but

i wouldn't describe it as being fun once

again tesla model 3 just has that edge

in terms of

the handling capabilities i'm not sure

many people buying these cars are really

going to care that much

it holds the road well and that's what

it needs to do and it does that fine

now i've come to the end of my time with

the Polestar 2 so i've got to take the

car back but before i do i just want to

check

my energy consumption so it is below

40. let's see what it is exactly

by using the trip computer here so i've

averaged

35 kilowatts per 100 miles

which means that my range would be

this number on the screen here and

that's through a mix of driving so

that's probably what you can expect

from this car in reality now i don't

know whether that's good or knocks i

can't see it right now

so i'll give you a selection of faces to

apply to it so

is it or

or there's only one last thing for me to

do

hey google play jessica by the allman

brothers band

on spotify

so then what's my final verdict on the

new Polestar 2 should you

avoid it should you consider it should

you shortlist it or should you just go

right ahead

and buy it well i reckon you should

shortlist the new Polestar 2

it may be not quite as quick or as good

to drive as a tesla model 3 but it's not

far off

and it is better looking inside and out

do you agree with my verdict let me know
