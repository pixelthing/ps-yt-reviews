let's play a fun game what happens when

volvo decide to set up a performance

sub-brand that only uses ev powertrains

and uses all that amazing scandinavian

design language and engineering

and also ethical materials this is what

happens it's a genuine tesla model 3

rival and it's called

the Polestar 2

and i think there's an airplane behind

me

[Music]

it's not it's a six wheeled john deere

gator with merlin at the wheel

[Music]

so the Polestar 2 came after the

polestar 1 and the polestar 1 is

actually a plug-in hybrid

two-door coupe sports car which i

haven't driven yet that will come on a

future episode

but this is their first kind of

more affordable mass production car this

is their critical party piece really

because this is going to

hopefully take the fight to tesla and

talking of tesla

i think this looks bigger than the model

3 but in actual fact it's 87 millimeters

shorter and this side profile is quite

critical because you can immediately see

that polestar have made a conscious

effort

they haven't chased the suv silhouette

they haven't gone down the road of the

eqc like mercedes or the audi e-tron

no they've said we're going for this

kind of thing it looks like a saloon

but it's actually a secret hatchback so

the tesla model 3 has the ha

as the boot you know the saloon boot but

this actually has a more practical hatch

which i'll show you in a second the

other thing i love about this

this shape volvo design scandinavia

design is is always quite

simple but striking there's this concave

piece at the bottom of the door and a

really sharp

shoulder line here and like

frameless wing mirrors

they they're very it's very odd when

you're driving the cab there's no

there's no surround to the glass it's

just completely open

so what is powering the Polestar 2 well

this is the launch model

so it only really comes in one flavor at

the moment this is a 300 kilowatt

um power car it's 150 kilowatt motor at

the front driving the front axles

150 at the back so four wheel drive

siemens motors made in china and then

it's got a 78 kilowatt hour battery pack

and that doesn't like a lot of evs it

doesn't sit in the belly of the car

it actually sits down the tall center

console and under the seats and the

reason for that

according to polstar will be clear when

we get in it

so it's a five door it's slightly higher

off the ground than you'd normally see a

saloon and this particular car

has the optional performance pack and

you can tell that from there

because there's bits of gold there there

and here this is probably my favorite

bit of the Polestar 2 actually the back

end

it's got these great kind of concave

strange lights which go around the

perimeter and they're all led and they

do some cool chasing

Polestar badge there with the two kind

of arrows inter-pointed which look a bit

like

ds the brand that citroen says it's

nothing to do with but it sort of is

but this is the important bit

that because obviously a tesla model 3

is a saloon and that's kind of annoying

for a lot of people especially europeans

and this addresses that problem polestar

said they wanted to definitely make sure

the boot had really easy

large access despite the fact that

boot's actually slightly smaller

than the tesla this is a 405 litre boot

but

it's got some cool stuff

it's got a divider and then it's got

another bit down there and then it's

actually got another bit at the front

it's got a fruit

albeit not quite as big a fruit frunk

as the Tesla Model 3

[Music]

hey google can you mute the navigation

muted voice guidance

thank you

well there you go first things first the

inside of the Polestar

well it feels pretty special in true

volvo scandinavian style they

have made a point of calling this the

vegan interior and there's been a bit of

this used in volvos

as well materials that are much better

for the environment recycled fibres

low impact plastics and alternative

materials

and it's bizarre because some of it has

a much different

texture to what you're used to

apparently even this steering wheel

cover is

is vegan vinyl

i i i'm fascinated by it i think modern

volvos have always had very interesting

materials

so it's great to kind of explore these

different levels on the dash

and this headlining which

has a certain feeling to it but it it

still feels premium

it's something that scandinavians seem

to do very well

although the germans have done it

fantastically with the

bmw i3 that's that's getting on a bit in

terms of age but it does not look

old at all and it's used as alternative

kind of materials there is a bit of

reconstituted wood here and you can get

that in lighter brown

this particular car is optioned with

quite a lot of kind of gray

and muted tones but you can see this

center console is really high

less like the tesla more like the jag

iPace i would say

and the reason for this is because pole

star says

the batteries live down in here

and across underneath the back seats

like a t arrangement

the idea being they put them here so

that the foot wells would still be nice

and deep

there wouldn't be a false flaw for the

battery packs and that often is the case

in the back end

where adults suffer with their um

with their leg room a bit

i haven't been in the back yet i'll go

in the back shortly

so this feels volvo-ish this steering

wheel

and this is volvo here and this really

this little

selection of buttons of which what

there's three four

they're the only buttons they're the

only physical buttons

and a couple on the wheel everything

else is on this portrait

tablet that's obviously been influenced

by the tesla 3.

it sits kind of proud of the dash

and this is the first car this is a

world first

for a car maker to use the google

operating system so this really lives

and breathes on google os

and as a consequence you can use the

assistance you can um

you can use things like spotify through

here

all kinds of stuff and i've put it to

good usage i'm always a bit skeptical

of stuff like this because to be honest

it it doesn't always work but so far

it's been brilliant

let me just try it now now that we're on

camera

and see if it fails me hey google

play the smith and sniff podcast

all right here's the latest episode of

smith and sniff

the india's grenadine on google podcasts

i mean

this is a great podcast if you haven't

already subscribed to it

it's fantastic hey google

stop

yeah listen to this indicator noise

it's weird it sounds like someone is

clicking one of those little clickers

you know those little metal

uh clickers like a fidget spinner type

thing

that's what it reminds me of anyway

we'll be able to get a good idea of um

of the chassis of the Polestarter

because the thing

that i'm really wanting to get under the

skin off

is the Polestar 2's

chassis now the one that i'm driving you

can tell because i've got the gold seat

belts

that it has the optional performance

pack there's a 5 000 quid

option with 20 way adjustable olin's

dampers now owens are a swedish

company that makes suspension regarded

as one of the world's best

but it's manually adjustable suspension

so not push button

touchscreen stuff that you'd get on a

lot of modern

sports cars you actually i believe have

to climb under the car and tweak it with

spanners if that's your

bag but remember this is a steel car

the the underpinnings of this are not uh

it's not an

a ground-up ev uh as such it's got

um chassis parts from the volvo xc40 now

i know

Polestars say they're pole style

they're not volvo but

it's a subsidiary of volvo and i still

think of it as form there's nothing

wrong with

thinking it's a volvo volvos are

fantastic now they're better than

they've ever been

so but the one thing that volvos have

always been is very comfortable

and perhaps not the most kind of sharp

in terms of steering

and in terms of chassis

this is unusually stiff

this has the optional brembo brakes as

part of that performance package

painted gold nice calipers but i'm

actually

in this instance i'm not really i don't

really know how good they are because i

don't need them

because the regen breaking isn't that

good

so that begs the question how hard are

you going to push it

do you really need that on the other

hand though

compare this to a model 3 tesla teslas

have notoriously weak brakes

the calipers the discs so they're made

of chocolate

and the other thing about tesla's is

they tend to be softly

set up whether that's for an american

market or

it's for more of a relaxed drive but

it certainly feels a lot

more engaged than that

the feeling i'm getting from the

Polestar 2 really is in terms of its

interior and then in terms of the fact

that it's quite focused as a as a

handling

engaging car it's more jaguar i pace in

many ways than

than it is tesla three

and that's no bad thing because i really

like the ipace i think

a lot of people discount the ipace

because they just look at

stats like range and um

you know the tesla charging network and

they they don't give it a chance but if

you drive

the i-pace it's a fantastic car and it's

been out a couple of years now already

you know it's

it got there early and it is a ground-up

ev

300 kilowatts so 200 150 kilowatt

motors um

487 pounds feet so it's about 670 newton

meters of toxic sixty

um and it's punchy i have to say it's

punchy

top speed of this is 127. i won't be

doing that today because sadly i'm not

allowed

which is pretty high considering volvo

caps its speed normally at 112

and i know it's not a volvo but it sort

of is

it's quiet though in here this one's got

the the panoramic roof

which i do like

[Music]

it does feel so stiff

i'm not getting much in the way of body

flex

i'm not feeling much in the way of

understeer

[Applause]

i don't know whether having smaller

wheels might make this car ride a bit

better but because this has got the

performance pack you've got 20 inch

forged

rims and they're really good quality

rims again look if you're going to

compare it directly to a tesla

tesla cannot design wheels they look

absolutely dog [ __ ]

whereas these wheels have a beautiful

quality to them

and a design to them that tesla don't

have and i am not

i'm not like bad-mouthing tesla before

all of the uh tesla disciples start

mauling me

tesla has changed the game

without a doubt tesla's drive trains are

um um almost unrivaled but this is the

bit

that tesla needs to learn a bit better

and

things like the brakes things like the

suspension they're they're they'll get

there and they'll get in they'll get

there very quickly but that's what

legacy manufacturers as people like to

call them that's where these guys excel

what's weird is i am in you know a

sensible passenger car

i'm in a i'm in a i keep wanting to call

it a saloon but it's not really a saloon

i'm in a mid-sized patch luxury

hatchback

that doesn't look sporty as such it

doesn't look

sensible and yet it's got this sort of

race tune

quite harshly race tunes damping going

on

[Music]

that seems to jar with the rest of the

car because the rest of the interior and

stuff wants to be a bit more easy

listening

oh there we go you feel like i thought

we were gonna have a little incident so

it's it's

it's poor it's pulled me in so tight

that i feel like i'm wearing a corset

there we go it's released me because

it's a Polestar

um volvo group car safety is is

is an absolute tantamount

and that's why it weighs they say that's

why it weighs more than

say the tesla equivalent by about 200

kilos there's a lot of safety kit going

on in here

a lot plus obviously batteries plus

paramotors

[Music]

now the Polestar 2 is nippy

4.7 seconds to 62 so it's

it's it's right there with the i-pace

jag

but it's down on performance compared to

the

tesla model 3 performance remember

there's three

tesla model threes and this sort of sits

in the middle price wise

this comes in at about 47 48 000 pounds

so what do you get if you're 47 48 49

000 pounds well you've got a 78 kilowatt

hour battery pack

uh that consists of i think 78 modules

pouch cells made by lg chem so they're

korean

cells and they live like i said before

in a t configuration inside here

that provides you with 292 miles of

range

um wltp in the real world you can expect

to probably shave

i don't know 15 to 20 miles off that

depending on your driving style

geography of the land preheating blah

blah blah blah blah all the usual

eevee differences

but what's really really nice about this

car

is it doesn't have i'll show you here

it doesn't have a sport mode so up here

you've got four icons

if i press the car icon you've got drive

assist

charge and more now the drive these are

your driving options

you have the steering feel three

adjustments of steering feel i've got it

in the firmest

setting because i actually prefer a kind

of a firmer steering wheel i don't like

a light

numb feeling wheel then you've got one

pedal drive

which is either off low or standard i've

got it on standard and it's really

aggressive

like in the most aggressive i'd say

compared to the most aggressive of the

bmw i3

and i've got creep on which is like to

simulate an automatic gearbox

creeping when you take off the brake and

then you've got

electronic stability control sport mode

which allows for a bit of slippage

remember this is a four wheel drive car

Polestar have said they're going to do

a single motor version

so a bit like when tesla brought out the

Tesla Model 3 um

it came out originally with a dual motor

but there is a single motor

version that's cheaper they'll be the

same with this

and then that is it there's no like

sport mode there's no hyper speed

nonsense there's no app for guffing

that i can find then you've got all the

assistants now obviously being

volvo's parent company

Polestar is under the jeely owned

umbrella gilly being a huge

chinese company who also owned lotus and

the london electric vehicle company

they're big on safety really being on

safety so this has

a lot of things driver aids roadside

information collision avoidance

blind spot assist all of those

sorts of things which you can turn on

and turn off

the Polestar charging menu here you can

choose your charge limit again it's

quite simple

it's nowhere near as nerdy as a lot of

other evs

you can choose your method of charging

and you can see either on there and on

here on the right hand side

the status of the batteries and this

screen in front of you

here it's 11 inches long that is a wide

the binacle the graphics are really

minimalist

playing it down each time it's not it's

not too fancy like a lot of the graphics

on

like a lot of japanese evs and things

like that it's not like that

it's it's just some simple bar charts

and then i can change the configuration

on the steering wheel

there you go i can put my nav in there

like that

um and then the other menu

on the tablet is your apps so i've got

my phone i've got my google maps here

got my media player i've got my driver

performance

which shows me how i'm doing how i'm

averaging how i'm doing right now

and my trip counter that sort of stuff

there's there's some cubby holes either

side of this high center console

there's cordless uh wireless charging

down in there

with a couple of usbc

chargers it started to rain

but yeah 292 miles of range um

at best depending on how you drive it

and because this has got the performance

back it's on 20 inch wheels

and the first thing i have noticed with

this car all of the controls are very

responsive and quite taut

the car has a very supple ride it is a

firm

ride much much firmer than i was

expecting

yes you can adjust the the olin's shocks

on this

this optional model but you can't do it

electronically

at the push of a button you have to

actually get spanners out

um so according to to polestar's

chassis engineer who i was talking to

they have really really designed this

car with performance in mind

so i would suggest you only option the

performance pack

if you're thinking of taking the car on

kind of track days or you like to push a

car

really hard teslas often have terrible

brakes as standard

it's known they've got awful brakes

they're under braked most of the time

this addresses that problem with the

huge brembo calipers but to be honest

i'm hardly ever using them

because of the one pedal driving

so i went out for a quick drive and

because it's a summer evening i thought

we'd get a bit of sunshine and some

low low sun no we get rain

so i've come in and huddled under a tree

and i'm going to talk about the front

end

the front end is really nice it's kind

of shallow and it looks really wide it's

got these creases

either side of the bonnet which i think

make it look very very kind of

masculine and handsome this grille

is a Polestar kind of key hallmark

they're these squares

it's actually hardly got any apertures

and there's active cooling in there to

let air in for the radiators

and the liquid cool battery packs as and

when but it also cleverly disguises

the radar and the cameras which are

around about there

you see the the logo here not chrome

keeping it nice on the download in that

way that the scandinavians are so good

at

i really like that it is a bit of a big

bonnet and it is quite i guess quite a

conventional

looking car but you can see there's the

sort of thor's hammer style

or they're either thor's hammer or the

tail of a

dolphin i can't work it out but you've

got this design language here which is

similar

to volvo under the front

i'm going to pop the bonnet because i

actually haven't looked under here yet

so similar to the tesla 3

it does have a little bit of storage

under here you can't see any of the

motors or anything like that you just

got screen wash there

and then you've got this little very

shallow i think it's 35 liters

of storage here mostly for your cable

really this is your cable tidy area

it's enough actually it's a little bit

better than i thought you know you got

the um

tyre inflation kit down there so that's

where all your cable nonsense goes and

the back can be kept that really big

hatch can be kept for

your normal practical shopping stuff

what i like about this

is i think it looks more expensive than

it really is

one thing i think about a tesla is if

you're buying a high-end

tesla 3 performance it's 55 grand

this with all the kit on is is just

under that but i actually think this

looks more expensive

look at it look at it it looks better

than any audi

it's brilliant looking thing

charging right here's where you charge

on the side here it'll charge up to 150

kilowatts of rapid charger using the ccs

if it's totally empty which it never

will be it'll go zero to 80

in 40 minutes the other thing that

polstar have done is they've teamed up

with plug sharing

which is a europe-wide public network

and using this

little rfid card you can swipe and use

thousands of different charge points

just to make it a little bit easier

that's the key fob it's a bit cheap and

nasty but

Polestar promise that you'll be able to

use your phone soon to unlock and start

the car

anyway let's have a sit in the back

okay first time i've sat in the back of

the Polestar 2

first thing i notice is these seats here

are higher

than the seats at the front and i'm

guessing that's because underneath here

is half the battery pack

the other half being down there as i

said before and that's why you've got

this quite

high transmission tunnel so the person

in the middle at the back

is going to have a pretty unfair hump to

deal with so they should be a child

really

but apart from that when i get in and

sit this has got the panoramic roof

i thought it would feel a bit

claustrophobic because the doors are

very very

high the sill line is really high and

this pillar back here this

this c-pillar is quite dense for the

driver but

it's really nice because i can see i'm

well over the

back of this seat i can see well over

sorry i was just on social media so

here's what i think

this is what i think about the car this

is clearly a driver-focused ev

it's more down the road of the jaguar

i-pace i think than the tesla model 3

and by that i mean

it's got more driver orientated steering

and suspension and brakes

i actually think when this is put next

to the i-pace it's priced

really well even with all the

performance kit on it it's still

probably

nearly 10 grand less than an i-pace

it depends what your priority is if you

want sheer range then a tesla model 3

will probably win but the thing i like

about the Polestar 2 is the package i've

said it before

it's a really strong package i love the

design

aesthetically it knocks spots off the

tesla inside and out to me

292 miles of range wltp

is pretty good good strong network of

dealers from

volvo i think as a first effort a full

ev first effort from them i think it's

wonderful

and remember i think this could be the

best quality car

that's ever been made in china

it's a chinese scandinavian mashup as is

always the case thank you so much for
