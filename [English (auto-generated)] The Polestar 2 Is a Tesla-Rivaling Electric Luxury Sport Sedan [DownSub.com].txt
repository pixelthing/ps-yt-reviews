this is the 2021 pulstar

2 and it's a fully electric car from

volvo's new

pulstar brand which was created for

electric vehicles

this is the first fully electric pole

star model it's

a sports sedan it starts around 60 000

and it's a little smaller than a bmw 3

series and today

i'm going to review it

before i get started be sure to check

out cars and

bids which is my new enthusiast car

you can see here some of our tesla

results

they've all been fantastic and we've

done very well with tesla so if you're

looking to sell

your tesla or any other interesting or

cool car from the 1980s and up

selection and daily auctions

at carsandbids.com so let's talk

Polestar 2. make no mistake this is

polstar's first

real shot at tesla and this is a direct

rival to the tesla model 3.

this starts around 60 000 it comes

standard with all-wheel drive and it's

fully electric

with a range of about 235 miles it also

has some pretty impressive numbers it

has just over

400 horsepower and just under 500

pound-feet of torque

allowing for a 0-60 time of around 4.7

seconds so the question is what's better

the Polestar 2

or the model 3. today i'm going to

review this car i'm going to try to find

out first i'll take you on a tour of the

Polestar 2 and show you all of its

interesting quirks and features

then i'll get it out on the road and

drive it and then i'll give it

a dug score

all right i'm going to start the quirks

and features of the Polestar 2 with

getting in there's a surprisingly large

amount to discuss here

i want to start with the key which is

just a regular volvo key since polstar

is volvo's electric luxury brand

except this pulstar key has the pulstar

logo in the corner

but otherwise it's basically just vulva

more interesting though is the activity

key

that would be this thing and you can see

it's smaller than the normal key but

it still gives you access to the car the

theory here is

if you're going to do something

outdoorsy or fun and you don't want to

take the regular key because you're

worried you might lose it or damage it

you bring the activity key it's smaller

easier to put in a shoe or a pocket or

whatever

and it's even waterproof up to 30 feet

meaning that you can dive with your

activity key and then come back to your

pull star 2 and unlock the door and get

inside

and you don't have to worry about

messing up your regular key but there

are more interesting quirks worth noting

before you climb inside one is the tail

lights when you unlock the Polestar 2

you can see the taillights do this cool

dance kind of letting you know that the

car

recognizes you and it's just neat to see

more and more automakers are doing these

lighting dances when you approach the

car but this is kind of a cool one

also cool with the lighting on the

outside of this car when you approach it

you can see a Polestar logo in the

sunroof on top

lighted up when you walk up to the car

that just

looks cool the polestar logo in a place

you would absolutely never expect it and

i think that's kind of a neat touch

if you notice it and speaking of the

Polestar logo

you'll see a lot of Polestar logos on

the outside of this car but you won't

see the word

Polestar anywhere you got a Polestar

logo on the trunk

on the front on all of the wheel caps

but it doesn't say

pull star anywhere on this car which i

think is kind of strange for a new

vehicle from a new

brand trying to raise awareness no not

this car they're just trying to keep it

subtle and cool and

you got to know what it is very strange

i think for a new brand the only place

it says Polestar

on the outside of this entire car is on

the brake light on the side

you can see it says polestar very tiny

no one would ever notice that most

people will get behind this in traffic

and they'll have no clue

what it is but anyway next up we climb

inside the Polestar 2 there are a lot of

quirks and features to discuss in here

but when you're getting inside you'll

notice the door sill even that doesn't

say pull star again

just the pole store logo they are really

keeping it subtle on this car you really

have a hard time figuring out exactly

what it is but

you climb inside and to start the car

you just kind of

go there's no start button you don't put

a key anywhere you just kind of get in

it recognizes you're there

you shift into drive and you go there's

no starter or

stopper frankly to turn it off you just

put it in park walk away

and it turns off automatically a little

bit hard to get used to but that's how

it works

but anyway once you get into get going

you just shift into gear using

this weird gear lever it's like a

strange

hexagon with a hole through the center

and an illuminated Polestar logo at the

bottom i must say i actually kind of

like this gear lever but it's certainly

a little unorthodox for an

unorthodox car now next up i want to

move on to technology because that's a

big part of this new crop of electric

cars

especially when you're competing with

the model 3 which has some fantastic

technology in the center

you have this large screen that is very

different from screens in

other volvo models the pulstar 1 had

pretty much a volvo system

this is a totally new thing completely

new generation

and it's operated very differently this

is your home screen you can see it's

divided into four sections

you have your navigation system you have

your media player your phone

and then you have a little assistant you

can tap it and i guess just tell it what

you want it to do sort of like siri on

apple devices

now navigation is done through google

maps and i must say it is tremendously

easy to use if you use google maps

you just tap it in putting a destination

is easy looking at the map moving it

around everything

very easy to use with the navigation

system in this car just tremendously

simple and very responsive to your touch

which of course is really important

now on this home screen you have your

climate controls at the very bottom on

this little strip

and you can see it's pretty much only

the most basic controls for instance tap

this part at the lower left to turn on

your

seat climate controls your heated seat

or your heated steering wheel you can

also change the temperature here

and the fan speed but the thing about

this infotainment system is it's all

about swiping swipe swipe swipe in every

direction

if you want more climate controls you

take that little climate control strip

at the bottom

you swipe up and then you have access to

a larger amount of climate controls

where you can make more adjustments if

necessary like for instance where you

want the air to come out or

various other climate items now if you

want the climate controls to go away

interestingly you just tap this little

white line at the bottom of the screen

that sends you back to your home screen

this is not a button it's just

touch sensitive but you tap it and it

functions like a home button and it

sends you back to your

four panel home screen no matter where

you are in the infotainment system but

anyway other interesting features in

this system in the upper left you have

an icon

that looks like a camera if you tap that

it turns on your backup camera or you

can press

360 and turn on the 360 camera it's a

very

large view that shows you all around the

car very crisp

camera footage and it shows you exactly

what you want to see to make it easier

for parking or navigating in tight

spaces

next up the next icon along the top

looks like a car and if you press that

obviously

it allows you to adjust various

different car settings the first panel

here

lets you change driving settings like

for example the steering

feel if you want more precision or just

lighter

easier steering feel you can also adjust

your one pedal driving here

if you want to turn that off or have it

on or even a higher sensitivity so you

have various

car items that you can change here the

next tab lets you configure your assist

system so

all of the different safety assist

features that this car has

and they are numerous you can configure

here turn them on turn them off

or adjust their sensitivity and that's

pretty standard in the next tab

you can adjust how much you want the car

to charge so you can

set like a maximum charging point for

the car if you bring it up to 100

it lets you know they only recommend

charging it to 90

to try to save battery life but you can

go beyond the 90

if you want and that lets you adjust

exactly where you want the charging to

go

the last part is the settings in the car

nothing particularly interesting or

weird in here your typical car settings

although i do like

if you do like a vehicle check it tells

you that it checks the car and

all is good with an exclamation point

all's good

don't worry Polestar 2 all is good in

here it's kind of a funny way to phrase

it

but it's some nice casual language in

your Polestar infotainment system

anyway your next icon along the top

these little boxes that is your app

section you tap that and it shows you

all the apps that the car

offers for you and i should remind you

that at any time you can go back to your

home screen by tapping this little white

line at the bottom of the screen

so if you get on your app screen or

somewhere else and you're confused you

don't really know how to get back just

tap the white line

and you're back home that's the basic

tour of the infotainment system now next

up i want to talk

gauge cluster which in this car of

course is a full screen

like it is on a lot of modern cars over

on the left you have your gear selection

nothing unusual there you also have the

speed limit for the road that you're

currently on again pretty standard

and next up moving into the middle you

have your current speed in large

print showing the speed you're currently

traveling then next up you have a little

display

that shows charge versus power on either

side if you're flooring it

that little thing lights up all the way

over to power whereas if you're braking

and

regen is going into the batteries to

charge the car then

charge will be fully illuminated and

this kind of shows you what you're doing

at any given time between

power and charge now finally over on the

right you

have your battery state basically it

tells you what percentage battery life

you have left

and your current mileage based on your

driving style and based on the current

battery charge

now like a lot of modern gauge clusters

you can also put the navigation

map into the gauge cluster you tap this

little button on the steering wheel and

then the map

shows up very large in the gauge cluster

showing you where you're going this can

be especially helpful if you have

navigation directions on

because then it's like right below where

you're looking on the road and you don't

have to take your eyes off the road to

look at the center screen

so you can have your map tap that icon

again and the map goes away

whether you want it there or not it's

pretty much your preference and by the

way if you're looking for a trip

odometer that can also appear with a

button on the steering wheel

tap this little circle button and then

your trip odometer pops out

letting you know your current trip

statistics mileage that sort of thing

and of course you can just put it away

and go back to a more clean look on your

gauge cluster if you don't want to see

it there now next up as for the rest of

this interior beyond the screens i have

to say

very simple simplistic minimalist

interior not quite

as much as tesla but there really aren't

that many

like for instance buttons in this car in

the center you only have a few buttons

you can see them here the hazard lights

and they look very nice that's

especially true of the little dial for

the volume

it just looks gorgeous this aluminum

trimmed volume

dial but i will say one drawback to this

rather simple interior you only have one

cup holder you can see between the seats

just

one which is unusual for a sedan i see

one cup holder sometimes in supercars

now

it is worth noting there is a second cup

holder inside this center console

storage area but

it takes up pretty much this whole

storage area so you're sacrificing

storage

for cup holder but one noteworthy quirk

also in the center console

you have this little packet which

contains the cloth

that is specially designed for cleaning

the infotainment screen when you get

fingerprints on it

you pull out this cloth with the pole

star logo all over it

and then you can just clean it off volvo

gives that to you because they know

you're going to be getting it

fingerprinted so how about a Polestar

branded cloth

next a few other interesting items this

interior one the glove box which is

fairly large as you can see the

interesting part is

there's like a shelf for the owner's

manual at the top so the owner's manual

doesn't end up taking up

so much of the glove box which is nice

to see another interesting quirk in here

is the center climate control vents the

ones on the left and right are in the

normal spots where you'd expect them

but the center ones are on the top of

the dashboard above

this center screen and you can see

they're almost sort of facing up towards

the windshield but you can adjust them

so that they're facing towards you

towards the cabin

so that they can blow air on you hot or

cold whatever

it's kind of weird placement for them

now with that said with this minimalist

interior and all this impressive new

technology i have to say

there is some very clear volvo stuff in

here ultimately polestar is a volvo

brand even though they're trying to be

very distant

they use some volvo parts that are very

clear like the steering wheel for

instance is straight out of most modern

volvo models

and volvo owners will recognize it right

away same deal with the window switches

and locks on the door panel

straight out of pretty much every modern

volvo and that's also true

of the stocks coming off the steering

wheel the turn signal the wiper stock

it's all

volvo parts but i will say there's less

part steering than i was expecting in

this car

and less than in the polestar one this

does feel like

mostly its own type of vehicle but

certainly there is some volvo in here

and next up we move on to the back seat

in the pollstar 2 and i must say it is

pretty tight back here

i have the front seat actually pushed up

pretty far and my knees are still right

up against the back of it

and my head is almost right up on the

ceiling this is not a huge car

like i said smaller in length than a bmw

3 series it's just not all that massive

but the back seat will do i just

wouldn't want to put like a very tall

adult in it for a long period of time

it's not the most comfortable place but

it's not that bad with that said there's

some notable nice stuff in the back seat

for one thing you have heated seats back

here you can see the controls in the

back of the front center console

you can tap them and turn on the heated

seats you also have

usb c ports back here for charging

devices you flip up this little lid

and there are your usbc so it's nice to

see that stuff back here some good

convenience and comfort

you also have gold seat belts in back

you can see all three

rear seats have gold seat belts same

deal up front

gold seat belts that's because gold is

the Polestar

color and to emphasize this that it's

their special

Polestar accent color they make three

things gold

the seat belts the brake calipers and

then also the

valve stem caps on the wheel that's it

that's all the gold you get in this car

even though that's Polestar's color

they've only chosen those three things

to make gold but they certainly stand

out the gold seat belts front and rear

but i must say the coolest thing back

here by far is the

sunroof you have a giant glass panel

going on the entire roof of the car with

no crossbar or anything interrupting it

you just have one

huge panel at the top and it just looks

so

open and airy back here you can see

everything the trees the sky the sun

it is kind of a cool look back here

sitting here and seeing that

massive sunroof it doesn't open but it

feels very open

as a result of it but anyway next we

move on to the cargo area of the pulse

star 2. it's important to point out

this is not really a sedan it's actually

a hatchback like so many

sedans are these days the whole back

lifts up and that gives you a slightly

larger cargo area than you would get

if it was just a normal sedan with a

normal trunk you can see pretty good

space back here and it's not just a

roomy cargo area back here polestar has

also integrated

a lot of interesting features to

maximize your practicality for instance

this little piece of the floor lifts up

and creates a divider back here so

if you are trying to carry your bowling

balls but you are also trying to carry

milk

then those two things can exist in

different parts of the trunk and they

won't roll around

and smash into each other you can also

lift up the entire cargo floor by

pulling here

and then you can see an entire lower

cargo area below the upper cargo area

where you can store even more stuff and

keep it away from the upper stuff

rolling around again

you also have this little net over on

the right side of the cargo area to keep

stuff in place

and you have this little strap over on

the left side of the cargo area to keep

even more stuff in place

so it really is a lot of practicality

back here

like you would expect from the swedish

and next up since i'm on the outside of

the Polestar 2 let's talk about some

other interesting exterior details

starting with the styling

which i love i think this is a gorgeous

sedan one of the best looking sedans on

the market

excellent proportions excellent design

great styling it really looks good

one interesting thing about this car

though is it isn't an suv

crossovers and suvs are so hot right now

but polestar has come out with two

models and they're both

cars although with this model you can

see they've kind of

jacked it up a little bit it has a

little bit increased ride height over a

regular sedan

it has this little plastic cladding on

the side to emphasize capability

and it has standard all-wheel drive i

think they wanted to create a sedan but

also make it sort of

suv-ish to try to lure some of those

people and so

that's what the Polestar 2 is mostly

sedan but

some suv also one quirky item worth

noting on the outside

is the mirrors when you adjust the

mirror for visibility you can see

the entire mirror moves to wherever you

adjust it very different from most cars

where you have just

the little inner piece of the mirror

moves and the housing stays put

not in this case in this car the entire

exterior mirror moves

whenever you adjust it a very strange

quirk but that's how this car is

and next up i want to talk powertrain so

we move under here

except that this isn't where the

powertrain is it's an electric car so it

doesn't have a big

engine up front instead you have a

little cargo compartment up here a

little divider where you can stick even

more stuff

if you run out of space in back now it's

worth noting that getting

into this cargo area is actually kind of

challenging there's no button on the key

that releases it

instead to get it open you have to go

into the driver's foot well pull up on

this little tab come around to the front

pop this little latch and then you can

get in here it's a lot of work for

not much cargo space as a reward but it

is in here just in case you need a

little more space

but i do actually want to talk

powertrain in this car and specifically

i want to compare it to the tesla model

3

which is probably its closest rival this

car starts around 60

000 and it does 0-60 in 4.7 seconds

with a 235 mile range those would be

pretty respectable numbers

if it wasn't for tesla and the model 3

performance which starts around 55

000 with a 315 mile range

0-60 in 3.1 seconds meaning

a model 3 performance is 5 grand cheaper

than this car

80 miles longer range and way

faster and on paper that just doesn't

make the value proposition

look too good for the Polestar 2. and so

those are the quirks and features of the

Polestar 2.

now it's time to get it out on the road

and see how it drives

alright driving the Polestar 2.

now i just went over the kind of value

proposition against model 3 and i have

that in my head

as i'm driving this car and as i'm

evaluating this car because this is kind

of the problem with a lot of modern

evs they offer a lot

but when you stack them up next to tesla

it's just difficult and this car has

less range less performance and it costs

more

that's a tough hill to climb no matter

how good everything else is and in this

car i gotta say everything else is

pretty good um i'm actually pretty

impressed with this car

i did the polestar one review and it was

a nice car but it was a

very narrow segment and it was plug-in

hybrid and a lot of volvo stuff

and it was very expensive and so i

wasn't i didn't have that high of hopes

for Polestar 2

but actually this is a pretty good car

in a lot of ways

i love the tech um better than tesla

probably i'm

i have to admit i'm kind of over the

whole model 3 doesn't have a gauge

cluster thing especially since all these

other rivals are coming out with

car evs that have them like the machi

mustang like this

and now even the new model s interior

well guess what they got a gauge cluster

in there again

to really drive home the point hey maybe

it's a nice thing to have and i think

that's a little bit annoying and frankly

a lot of these

systems have just improved so much that

tesla doesn't hold a distinct advantage

anymore

and i think that that's really important

to mention these

systems have been catching up to tesla

in in large part

and this is a fantastic infotainment it

works really well it's great

and then this car's other attributes are

also pretty good as well i think this

car looks great probably the best

looking ev

uh at least like practical ev yet

gorgeous sedan clearly looks better than

a model 3. model 3 is kind of frumpy

with its little

curvy this is better looking and of

course the performance is here over 400

horsepower in this car just under 500

pound feet of torque zero to 1647 i

floor it

it is quick quick

quick quick quick

it's a fun car to drive it is it's

pretty quick and you can adjust the

sensitivity of the steering you can make

it pretty

sensitive to your movements which you

know benefits you it makes it feel like

it's a

sharper car on the road ride quality in

this car is pretty good

um it's reasonably comfortable and

reasonably quiet in terms of road noise

and

and exterior noise it isn't like a very

nice luxury car you still are hearing

stuff but it's about what you'd pay at

this price point for a gas powered car

it has about the same level of vibration

and harshness that sort of thing now one

interesting item at this car they kind

of jacked it up from a normal sedan like

i mentioned to make it seem sort of suv

is when your driving car does not feel

like that

it just feels like you're driving a car

one pedal driving this car

very easy you just accelerate like

normal but then you get off the

accelerator and the car slows down

pretty quickly and pretty easily it'll

basically slow you down all the way to a

complete stop

and then you can adjust whether you want

the car to creep forward at stop lights

or not and if you don't

then it'll just come to a complete stop

and stay there really it's kind of an

interesting thing this car because this

is a very competent electric car and

i've driven two very competent electric

cars recently the most competent ones

i've driven the mock e

and this and the maki is great

and this is very good and they would

both be unbelievably strong electric car

efforts if it wasn't for

tesla you look at tesla and it's just

difficult to compete there now i think

the mach e

actually does directly compete and in

some ways is considerably better

this car has a little better tech has

definitely better styling

is that worth an extra five grand losing

range losing performance it wouldn't be

for me

it's a great car it drives really great

but i think this car only really makes

sense if you can get a very good deal on

it i don't know what their deals are

like or their incentives

but if you can equate this in price to a

model 3 performance

then it starts to maybe make a little

sense you do give up a little

the power for maybe a better interior

nicer looking car

i could see that and so that's the pull

star

2. this car offers some real benefits

over the tesla model 3 including

exterior styling interior quality and

some

tech features but tesla remains more

compelling for less

money and it's just impossible to ignore

the value proposition the model 3 has

over basically every other ev this gets

close

but it doesn't quite get there but now

it's time to give the polestar

2 a doug's score

starting with the weekend categories and

styling the Polestar 2 is gorgeous

frankly for a sedan and it gets a 7 out

of 10.

acceleration does 0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds

and it gets a 6 out of 10.

handling is fine and handles well but

it's not sports car sharp and it gets a

5 out of 10.

fun fact are same it's fast but not

blistering and it handles well but not

like a sports car it's good but not

insanely fun and it gets a 5 out of 10.

same deal with cool factor these are

cool new interesting cars but not really

head turning and they don't have the

tesla hype it gets a 5 out of 10

for a total weekend score of 28 out of

50. next to the daily categories and

features the Polestar 2 is very well

equipped with great amenities and great

tech and it gets a 9 out of 10.

comfort is normal for a car like this

and it gets a 7 out of 10.

quality is excellent with good materials

throughout and it gets an 8 out of 10.

practicality is good it has nice

interior room and all-wheel drive but a

relatively lower range than some might

want keeps the score limited to a 5 out

of 10.

finally value and this is an okay value

but it's just hard to justify against

tesla models that seem to offer more for

less

it gets a 5 out of 10 for a total daily

score of 34 out of 50.

added up in the dug score is 62 out of

100 which places it here against

relevant cars

the Polestar 2 is an excellent vehicle

but the model 3 performance is just

seemingly unbeatable the pulstar looks

better and it has arguably better tech

but the model 3 performance is better in

more places where it matters it's faster

it handles better it has a longer range

and it's less money

my heart prefers the Polestar 2. it's

certainly more interesting than the

model 3 performance but

the tesla is the better overall car
