this is the new single motor version of

the Polestar 2 it's the entry-level car

and i'm going to find out if it's a

little bit like fake tan

is it a case of less

is more now to do that i'm going to take

it for a drive we're going to launch it

to time it from 0 to 60 miles an hour

i'm going to talk you through the

differences between this single motor

version and the more expensive dual

motor version if you like videos about

stop car buying comparison site let's

start this review by talking about the

design changes of the single motor

version of the Polestar over the dual

motor which i've already reviewed here

at the back

looks identical i like the rear end i

like the design of this light it's

really cool especially when it's

illuminated down the side what's

different what's different

nothing looks the same so it's like a

hatchback that's slightly jacked up so

kind of like a sort of cross between a

hatchback and an suv i'm not going to

say the word crossover because normal

people don't even know what that means

sounds a bit like cross-dressing

wheel size starts at 19 goes up to 20s

so big wheels ah there is one difference

it's this sticker here because this

sticker donates the battery capacity and

the power output so that changes with

the single motor model here at the front

once again exactly the same as the dual

motor good looking car love the

headlight design now prices this car now

starts at 40 000 pounds because you can

get it with a slightly smaller battery

and that single motor now if you want to

now let's talk about charging batteries

and the motor so this car has a front

mounted motor driving the front wheels

via a single speed automatic gearbox you

can get two sizes of battery a 61

kilowatt hour usable battery size and

then a 75 kilowatt hour one which is the

same as in the dual motor car now that

smaller battery can charge at a maximum

rate of 116 kilowatts the larger battery

can charge at maximum rate of 155

kilowatts in terms of the range they'll

give you the larger battery will give

you a range according to Polestar of

335 miles the smaller battery will give

you a range of 273 miles as for the

performance well for some reason if you

go for the bigger battery you get a

slightly more powerful motor it has

231 horsepower the smaller battery comes

with a bit less power because it's a bit

lighter so it puts out

224 horsepower however both single motor

versions of the Polestar 2 have the same

top speed and they both do nought to 60

in the same time as well now i'm going

to launch this card to see how quick it

is a little later on in this video

before then though there's some other

things we need to look at Polestar i've

ever so slightly tweaked the suspension

for the single motor version of the pole

star team mcfirst and strut at the front

in case you're wondering multi-link at

the rear in case you're really really

boring and iraqi kind of person other

than that it's exactly the same as a

dual motor car so let's see how it

drives right let's try out this polestar

on a twisty road now the first thing to

note is the car feels quicker when

you're actually driving it because of

the instant pickup you get from the

electric motor and i really doubt

whether many people need to be going

quicker than this especially when you

come out of just like a normal car this

electric

car will feel extremely responsive now

in terms of the handling it goes around

corners look it goes around corners

there we go absolutely fine i'm not

really feeling anything through the

steering doesn't feel sporty it just

does the job and the job that it does

it's fine it's secure it's safe but it's

not that much fun it's quite unusual

actually for an electric car that's a

single motor to be front-wheel drive

especially in this kind of class and

normally rear-wheel drive which does

give you a slightly more sporty edge as

you're getting pushed out of the corner

rather than pulled through it now if you

want a sportier feeling electric car to

drive i'll put a link to one up there my

review of my favorite

sporty feeding electric car to drive

let's quickly talk about the brakes so

you've got 345 millimeter discs here at

the front gripped by twin piston

calipers at the back you've got 340

millimeter discs with a single piston

caliper but of course being an electric

car you've also got regen braking so the

motor actually works in reverse and puts

the electricity back in the battery bit

like a dynamo

electricity regen anyway let's just do a

break test got it at 60 let's see what

else stopping here we go breaking time

now

oh felt good to me 31 meters one of the

good things about this single motor

version of the Polestar 2 is that the

inside is the same as the more expensive

dual motor version i really do like the

design the texture on the dash the

quality feel the layout with this huge

center console separating you from your

passenger so it feels a bit sporty nice

design touches like the gear selector

shape with a Polestar light there and a

Polestar light there that reflects in

the optional glass roof the infotainment

system is easy to use and uses android

auto so it's super simple you've got a

very functional digital driver's display

not the most beautiful to look at but it

does its job nicely plenty of storage

here cupholders here cup holders there

decent size glove box and the driving

position is nice because this car is a

little bit higher than a normal

hatchback and if you jack the seat all

the way up

you really do get a good view over the

bonnet it's almost like you're in an suv

however if you want more of an suv

experience you need to check out the

ford mustang mac and if you click on the

pop-out banner up there or follow the

link in the description you can watch my

full in-depth video review of that car

now let's see what this Polestar 2 he's

like to drive in town so i'm actually

going to put the drive mode into

standard one pedal drive

i like to have creep off though don't

like it creeping forward and then you

can completely control it

on the accelerator pedal lift off and

it'll break and bring it to a stop it

just makes it easy to control you don't

actually have to touch the brake unless

there's an emergency stop and it blends

it all together quite nice it just feels

natural

the light steering works here let's go

super light there we are

good in town that is in terms of the

suspension over bumps it's all right you

know it's relatively comfortable

i drove the Polestar 2 ages ago in-depth

review on the dual motor version and

that had the performance pack with

olin's coil over suspension and that was

just too firm this one is fine much

prefer this do not get that performance

pack regardless of which pole style you

go for

as for the turning circle here we go

look at that there's me lifting off with

one pedal drive just slows it right down

about 11.5 meters

[Music]

yeah easy peasy

lemon squeezy

have you ever heard that in a car review

before it's a very professional matthew

well done

let's talk about practicality in this

car plenty of room in the back seats the

only minor issue is that headroom is a

little bit restrictive but most people

will be fine if you've got a little baby

you need to go to baby seat well a bit

annoying that you have to flip off the

ice fix anchor covers but once you've

done that it's easy to get the seat into

place and there is enough room for a

rear-facing seat in this car without

having to move the front passenger seat

forward minor issues the doors don't

open all that wide so you end up kind of

like having to work the seats in a

little bit it is slightly easier to get

a baby seat in the back for volkswagen

id3 which is similar in size in the back

and quite a bit cheaper and if you want

to see my full in-depth video review of

that car click on the pop-up banner up

there to go check it out here on the

motorway the Polestar is relaxing

enough i'm appreciating the slightly

raised driving position out here and a

bit of a better view over some of the

cars bit of wind noise a bit tire noise

but they're more noticeable because

there's no engine droning away it's

perfectly adequate in terms of the sound

insulation and the seats are comfy

supportive

i'm happy in this thing now check out

the acceleration though because

obviously if you need to suddenly

overtake let's say you're doing 16 you

want to overtake someone yeah there's

enough punch get you up to speed that's

all fine you've got to really question

whether you need the more powerful car

i'm fine with this car more than happily

do lots of miles in it

now it's time to look at five annoying

things about this car

personally i'm not the biggest fan of

the performance pack upgrade on the

Polestar 2 because it does make the ride

a little bit too firm however you may

want it unfortunately you cannot get it

at all on the single motor version which

means you won't be able to get those

lovely yellow seat belts

even with a single motor and the

smallest battery this Polestar 2 still

weighs in at 1940 kilos which is almost

250 kilos heavier than a tesla model 3

and it's quite a lot really for a car of

this size

this car doesn't get automatic cruise

control as standard you know the thing

where it'll steer to keep in lane and

use a radar to keep your safety distance

from the car in front if you want that

it's part of a 3 000 pound option pack

this car isn't fitted with it yet

bizarrely it still has the buttons for

the distance control for the automatic

cruise radar system

just

so you can pretend that you've got it

Polestar is supposed to be a premium

brand but their key fob is anything but

in fact it feels cheaper than the kind

of toys you get in a cereal packet i

told them about this about a year ago

when i reviewed the dual motor car and

they still haven't got around to sorting

it out guys you need to listen to me

oops it's broken

while pozdar may have removed a motor

from

the rear axle they haven't made any use

of that freed up space because the boot

capacity while acceptable on the boot

being practical with some storage area

in here is the exact same capacity as

the dual motor car 405 liters seems like

a wasted

opportunity

it's not all negative though here's five

good things about this car unlike most

other front wheel drive electric cars

this one does have some space underneath

the bonnet for storing your cables in

fact the capacity is 35 liters in case

you're wondering to be fair though the

dual motor version also has this storage

area

you might get a bit borderly waiting for

your Polestar 2 to charge don't worry the

car now comes with a space warp space

invader game look at this way you're

shooting polluters oh my god it's

topical as well yay i'm having so much

fun even though the single motor version

of the Polestar 2 has 180 less horsepower

than the dual motor the towing

capability is just the same 1500 kilos i

don't know why i'm pushing rather than

being towed rabbit that's me being a

toad

the introduction of this single motor

model with the smaller battery means

that you can get a Polestar 2 for 6 000

pounds less than you used to be able to

and if you look at a lease deal i'll

save you about 70 quid a month which you

could spend on a premium gym membership

the seat coverings used in this car have

won an award from peta we're not

talking about old peter from down the

pub who thinks he knows everything no

from peta the animal activists because

their production process is less harmful

to creatures than other car seats

apparently this Polestart supposed to

do not 60 in 7.2 seconds but let's see

what it will really do i've got my

specialist timing gear here it's going

to launch it

very steady smooth and dramatic

take off

but what will the time be 7.29 it's all

right

[Music]

so then once my final verdict on the

single motor version of the Polestar 2.

should you avoid it should you consider

it should you shortlist it or should you

just go right ahead and buy it well i

reckon you should shortlist it in fact i

think the single motor version with a

smaller battery is the pick of the

Polestar 2 range
