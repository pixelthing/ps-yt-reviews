polstar's first fully electric volume

model the Polestar 2 is a premium

performance fastback ev that delivers a

very swedish style alternative in the

segment for compact to mid-sized

electric models

its style is individual its driving

dynamics claimed to be surprising and

its core values are right on point for

these enviro conscious times

once on the move having shot away from

rest with the usual frantic eb sense of

forward thrust the Polestar 2 goes

about its business with a really rather

impressive deep very considered sense of

purpose roll is resisted the steering is

accurate and your slightly raised

driving position offers a feeling of

prop command and with the top long range

dual motor 78 kilowatt-hour battery

model we've chosen to test here

cornering grip is rarely lacking thanks

to two ac synchronous 150 kilowatt

electric motors one for each pair of

wheels offering all-wheel drive traction

and a combined 408 horsepower which is

more than enough to offset the rather

portly weight which is in part by

product of the all steel cma platform

which Polestar owners the Geely group

more usually use for suvs like this

car's almost identically engineered

cousin the pure electric volvo xc40

the long range dual motor variant we're

trying here offers 408 horsepower

although if you regularly use all those

brakes horses you will of course get

nowhere near this version's claimed 298

mile driving range figure the lighter

alternative uh 231 horsepower long-range

single motor mid-level Polestar 2 does

rather better with that car the same 78

kilowatt-hour battery will supposedly

take you up to 335 miles

if longer trips are less of an issue

then the cheapest option is the base 224

horsepower standard range single motor

derivative which uses a smaller 64

kilowatt-hour battery which offers a

range of up to 273 miles on all models a

drive part of the central screen allows

you to alter steering feel and the level

of retardation from the car's one pedal

drive brake regeneration system and with

this top long range dual motor variant

there's the option of a motorsport

orientated performance pack that'll give

you track ready brembo brakes stickier

continental sport contact tyres

those are on bigger 20 inch wheels and

race style olens dual flow valve

manually adjustable dampers as for

charging well you'll need the bigger 78

kilowatt-hour battery if you're going to

be able to use the fastest 150 kilowatt

public dc charges uh attached to one of

those you can replenish around 80 of the

power plants lithium-ion cells in around

40 minutes as usual with evs at present

though you're going to need most of the

night to charge up everything with the

car hooked up instead to a conventional

garage war box

as a car maker Polestar has an

intrinsically deep relationship with

volvo and so does this Polestar 2. back

in 2016 this design was originally a

volvo concept car the concept 40.2 but

when Polestar styling chief maximilian

misoni saw it he recognized in the

chiseled look a shape that was ready to

pioneer the style of an entirely new

brand this may be the second car the

company has made but it's the first true

Polestar

the tall chunky proportions certainly

couldn't be more different from the

sleek globular shape of a rival tesla in

fact it doesn't really look like

anything else at all which is what you

might most like about it in theory it is

a five-door fastback but it sits on the

compact modular architecture platform of

a volvo xc40 suv hence the high sided

look which polestar likes to describe

with words like urban and robotic

from the side you might consider that

the 2.7 meter wheelbase is rather too

short for the 4.6 meter body length and

adding this rather cheap looking battery

output sticking behind the front wheel

arch is unnecessary but the profile is

lovely it's embellished by blacked out

windscreen pillars which flow into the

cantilevered roof

the rear perspective is equally

arresting with strips of led lighting

that curl around the lower tailgate like

salvador dali's moustache

getting in and activating the car

requires nothing more than you should

have the key in your pocket but it's a

rather cheap looking square black thing

so you might prefer instead to download

the appropriate polestar app so the

whole entry and start thing can be uh

handled by your smartphone instead

it's a vegan interior apparently and if

you don't happen to be a vegan you may

view the prospect of that with all the

enthusiasm that you might master for a

trip to your local meat-free restaurant

but actually once you're inside well

it's all rather nice providing you

happen to like the whole paired back

scandinavian vibe that this car wants to

draw you into

the things that you most commonly

interact with like this curiously shaped

gear lever and the screen graphics

they're all bespoke

shared componentry with volvo that's

really been kept down to a minimum and

the overall feeling is of a cabin that

rather refreshingly isn't derivative of

anything else in the segment now unlike

in a tesla a Polestar hasn't tried to

cram everything into one central touch

screen

thankfully a configurable 12.3 inch

progressive instrument display

is provided here too but you are still

going to be using this 11.15 inch uh

portrait format middle monitor rather a

lot so it's just as well but thanks to

its uber sophisticated google android

automotive operating system

it's one of the best that you'll find on

any car at any price

it's brilliantly intuitive with built-in

voice control that's a speciality apple

devices are reluctantly accommodated and

even the integrated climate controls are

really easy to use other cabin

highlights include brilliantly

supportive seats here a much needed

standard fixed panoramic glass roof and

also a reasonable level of storage space

okay

time to take a look in the rear now the

door opens nice and wide

and it shuts again with a quality thunk

but you're not going to want to share

the rear part of this cabin with more

than one other adult because of the

protruding height of this central tunnel

that you think this car wouldn't need

because it doesn't have to house a

conventional transmission system but

which is necessary here to house some of

the lithium-ion battery cells positioned

underneath you

still legroom is very reasonable by the

usually relatively mediocre standards

that pervade in this class

we'll finish by taking a look at the

boot the hatch for which as you'd want

is power operated and embedded is

standard with a swipe function so you

can wave your foot beneath the bumper

like that and open it if you're

approaching the car or laden down with

bags the capacity revealed 364 litres is

some way down on what you get from a

rival tesla model 3 at 542 litres or

something conventional like say a bmw 3

series at 480. those two cars are

saloons this is a hatch so here you get

a more versatile loading space we like

the Polestar 2 and it couldn't be more

different from arguably its closest

rival the tesla model 3 that's an eb

that slightly awkwardly embraces the

current eco zeitgeist

yes it is easy to sneer at Polestar's

environmental mission statement to drive

progress and create a better future a

future that's sustainable hassle-free

and strikingly beautiful but we can't

help liking the way that this car has

delivered its electric remit with volvo

style pragmatism there's no big fuss

about superbike style acceleration times

or about how it can charge in next to no

time from rapid charging stations that

you'll hardly ever come across it

doesn't even mess about with a pointless

suv configuration

instead the polstar 2 simply gets on

with delivering what is arguably the

most complete ev experience in the 40 to

50 000 price bracket it has a tesla like

feel of innovation a mercedes eqc like

feel of quality and a jaguar i-pace-like

feel of sporting purpose or with rare

unique branding and packaging choosing

one of these would be a step into the

unknown but we can see why you might
