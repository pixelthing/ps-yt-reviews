this is a pull star 2 and the other day

i made a video

which was called seven things i really

really really like about this car so

link in the description box down below

if you want to check

out that video but in today's video i'm

gonna talk about

well six things i really don't

like about the Polestar 2 and at this

point it's kind of nitpicking because

if you saw my previous video i really do

like this car but there are a few things

that

well could be better in my opinion

before we start the video if you're new

to the channel thank you so much for

stopping by

i really do appreciate it and if you are

new i'm chris

i have this channel dedicated to testing

evs i do

range tests i do charging tests i drive

evs down to

zero percent to see just how far you can

go

on a single charge and also i found out

what happens when you are at

zero percent like in this video i shot

last week with

the jaguar iPace okay so now we got a

message

loss of drive seriously okay i have to

put on the hazards

we had five kilometers left and then we

just went into

zero this is today this is today i'm

stranded by the side of the road

wow how is this even possible if you

want to find out

what happens in that video and well how

i got home

link in description box down below that

was yeah

kind of a day that day didn't go after

plan so if these are the types of videos

walking up to the Polestar 2 is usually

a

very nice experience because in my

opinion

this is one of the best looking car

designs

of maybe the past decade i mean it's

really up there

when we're thinking about cars that

aren't supercars or sports cars you know

just

normal family cars i think this is one

of the best looking

designs out there and i really do like

it but this video isn't about what i

like

it's about what i don't like and what i

don't like is

the key because this is the key you use

while well walking up to the Polestar 2

usually it's in your pocket because this

car does have keyless go

and keyless entry but this is just

a black plastic box it's

not very nice the buttons are plastic

the whole casing is plastic

i mean the the design itself isn't you

know offensive

it's slim it fits nice in your pocket

though it could actually be a little bit

smaller now in 2021

but the real reason that you know this

is so bad

is because of the other keys that volvo

offer in their spa platform car so the

Polestar 2 is built on

the cma platform the same as the volvo

xc40

and they get these cheap plastic keys

but move up to the spa platform cars

you get a chrome and leather covered key

that

matches the interior color and i mean

it wouldn't cost that much more because

you can actually buy

change the covers for the volvo keys it

costs i mean a few thousand kroners

so at least if they gave it as an option

that you could you know spec it up with

a nicer key would make the whole

experience much better but this

plastic thing that is already very

scratchy

and ugly yeah i really don't like this

once upon a time i didn't mind glossy

black plastics as much as i

yeah really don't like them now in 2021

and that may be

because every car has a whole bunch of

glossy black plastics and they're

scattered all over the cabin

that it's kind of gimmicky it's kind of

cheap looking though this

portion here of glossy black plastics is

actually of

the nicer quality i've seen it's still

prone to scratching

scuffing and just collects dust and just

is dirty all the time it's never clean

it's only clean for about the five

minutes after you clean it and then it

collects dust

it collects fingerprints and down here

being a touch point because you know you

have your buttons you have your shifter

you will be touching this you will also

be resting your hand here

so if this was a different material it

would be much

much better but yeah because this is

glossy black plastics

i really don't like it

something i've talked about in so many

videos regarding the Polestar 2 is

the cup holder placement and i'm going

to just

let you guys try to figure out where it

actually is can you see the coupler

is it there is it there or is it

there it's actually it's actually right

here or

now you can see it because it's actually

hidden behind the armrest and

when you use a cup holder well you don't

have an armrest anymore

and if you want an armrest well you

don't have a cup holder anymore and if

you want the second coupler

that's actually behind this center

armrest so i mean it's kind of stupid

it's kind of a

very bad design flaw that i don't like

and there is

actually a fix which is this

thing here so link in the description

box

down below to a whole video i have

on the cup holders the stupid placement

and how i

actually really really don't like them

and this

fixer so i mean yeah it's no surprise

guys

if you've seen any of my poster two

videos that i really

don't like the cup holder placement in

this car

there's something weird about the dead

pedal placement in

this car it's not you know where it is

in the footwell because it's all the way

to the left like in every other car

it's just that it sits closer to

the driver than in most other cars

meaning that usually if you want to find

a comfortable position

your left leg will be at an angle and

yeah that's not

too comfortable you can compensate by

you know putting the seat at an angle to

get lower support and you do have you

know

this adjustable thigh support which is

very very nice

but this means that i have to sit a

little bit further

away from the steering wheel that i find

comfortable

i wish the dead pedal was just placed

because if you see there's

all this space here it and it may be

because of

you know the wheel well that the front

wheel is pushed all the way back and

that

may actually be the actual reason you

know while thinking about it

but i'm not a huge fan of of this and

it's very apparent you know hopping in

and out of all the different cars that i

drive

that the dead pedal placement is a bit

too

close to the driver than what i find

optimal and it's not the worst thing

but it's very apparent as i said after i

hop out from another car but then when i

get used to this and then i get the seat

into my position

it's actually not that bad but it is one

of the things that i

actually yeah really don't like about

this car

i have an iphone 12 pro

and this problem may only be

yeah for people who have iphone 12 pros

and not

other iphones or even other phone brands

because

there seems to have been an issue with

the wireless charging and the iphone 12

pro that

should have been fixed now but either

way i

am not a huge fan of these wireless

charging pads in these cars because

i don't think they're very powerful and

usually they just you know

keep your charge instead of actually

charging your phone

maybe you'll get a few percent but then

they heat up your phone

and i tried with and without a case it

really doesn't matter

so what i usually do in cars to have

reliable and fast charging

is plug in yeah my just my lightning

cable there

and then that comes to my yeah my point

number five

that i really don't like and that is the

placement of the usbc ports because

they just protrude out of the center

console like that why didn't they just

put it i mean

a bit deeper so you can actually use

this space but yeah it becomes

very impractical having the

usb ports you know just protrude like

that

it looks cool it looks pretty but it

just makes this whole

center storage area which we're going to

come back to in my

in my next point just a little bit less

useful so yeah not a huge fan

then we have my last point and you guys

may have seen this coming and

that is the lack of practicality here

in the center storage and i was thinking

very hard about this last point and as i

said in the intro

you know i'm almost nitpicking because i

sat here like what can i

what things can i find that i actually

don't like about the pull star

and i wanted to make a list of seven but

i couldn't find seven things

but one of the seventh thing would have

been you know which is

part of this point number six would have

been

the size of the center console but i

actually don't mind it i've gotten used

to it

and you have this nice cockpit feeling

and with this light colored nappa

leather interior with the light colored

wood

yeah it's not too intrusive and

and high and large i actually i don't

mind it at all

some instances i actually do like it

because you are cocooned you know

compared to other cars where this is

just an open area

it's actually quite nice but what i

don't like is

the practicality or the lack of

practicality as you guys saw in the

previous point

you have a wireless charging pad there

which you can charge your phone and then

i can connect

the usb uh lightning cable there to to

charge my phone and then basically i've

used up all

the space if i want to store my

sunglasses i can do that i'm going to

try to find them here with my left hand

um

yeah i mean there's not a lot of space i

can put them here but yeah

so i mean there isn't a lot of storage

it's kind of pathetic

you do have these small you know pockets

here

uh on this side that people have you

know talked about but i don't know

i always forget that they are there and

if you have storage that

you're really not aware of because

they're just hidden and you know not

very practical to use

i mean that is it really useful storage

then in my opinion i'm gonna argue that

that it isn't so i okay so you can i can

i can actually have my

place my sunglasses there but i know

when i'm driving i wanna reach down here

it's not very practical

it's better for me to have them in the

center armrest

in in my opinion so yeah last point

not a surprise to anybody who has seen

any of my

poster two videos this is basically

the biggest design flaw and the biggest

flaw of this car is

the lack of center storage especially

when

most evs are very practical compared to

non-evs where you have you know

large cup holders you have storage you

have dual wireless charging pads

yeah this isn't the the best solution so

yeah

yeah no brainer guys i don't i really

don't like this center

storage console you know practicality

aspect here

so there we go guys those were the six

things

i really don't like about the Polestar

2 and as i said several times in this

video

i'm basically nitpicking because yeah i

really do actually

love this car i've made a lot of videos

where i talk about how much

i like the this car it's one of my

favorite evs at the moment one of my

favorite cars

at the moment and many times when i'm

going out for a drive

and i'm going to choose between this and

my audi e-tron i

end up choosing the Polestar 2 for many

many

reasons and one of the main reasons is

just the way it drives it's it's a very

good

driving car and it is fast yeah it's

it's a cool car

i really do like it but let me know guys

are there any things that you think that

i missed that

i should have picked up on that maybe i

actually also don't like

and give me give me your six

things in the comment section down below

that you don't really like about the

postar 2
