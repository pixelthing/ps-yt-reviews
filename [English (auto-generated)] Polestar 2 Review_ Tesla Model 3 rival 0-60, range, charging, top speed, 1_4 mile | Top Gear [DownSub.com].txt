Polestar now you probably haven't heard

of them but they used to be volvo's

official touring car racing team but now

they've morphed

shape-shifted if you will into the

tastiest thing to come out of sweden

since

reindeer meatballs now they started

weirdly

with a hybrid powered coupe that was the

polestar

one it cost 120 000 pounds and they

don't make it anymore because now

they've given us this

all-electric saloon car welcome to the

Polestar 2.

[Music]

what is it the two is here to rival

stuff like tesla's model 3 and model y

the ford mustang mackie and weirdly

volvo's range of all-new electric cars

they share some of the same bits under

the skin but don't look

quite as handsome as this escaped

concept car

Polestar prices start at just under

forty thousand pounds

then you choose your interior and pay

extra for any color that isn't

black if you'd like to spend a little

bit more money 5 000 pounds there's the

performance pack with upgraded dampers

20 inch wheels and for your gold

addiction

gold seat belts gold brake calipers even

gold

valve caps what does it look like

it certainly looks 50 grams worth i hope

you like admiring glances from

complete strangers this thing is a

styling master class

mad for what's basically a jacked up

volvo

where's the charging port now you can

take the car

out of volvo but some old-fashioned

common sense is always going to stick

around

the charging port for example lives

beneath this state-of-the-art

plastic flap now unlike the tesla that

everyone's going to be comparing this

Polestar 2

you don't get your own dedicated

charging network

so you're going to be suckling off your

7 or 11 kilowatt home war box for

between 8 and 12 hours

if on your travels you find a 150

kilowatt rapid charger you could do a 30

minute top up now

that's okay but it's still not quite as

foolproof as

tesla's dedicated superchargers what's

the gimmick

if you spec the performance pack you do

get these rather natty

gold colored valve caps i want to do

nicely on ebay

will i get along with the tech well as

with any self-respecting

upstart electric car the centerpiece is

of course a giant

11 inch portrait touchscreen now this

has

crisp graphics it's rapid reacting and

that's because the polstar 2 is actually

the first car

to be based around google's operating

system and if you're waiting for me to

complain about touch screens being

really

fiddly to use when you're on the move

then Polestars come up with a nice

little piece of common sense

look the gear selector has a flat top so

you can

rest your arm on it when touching the

[Music]

screen

how fast is it now if you don't know the

drill by now it's very simple

instead of traipsing up and down a

runway all day like a lost pilot

i simply accelerate in that general

direction and use this little gps box of

tricks to give me accurate acceleration

data

so you know what you can expect in the

real world

so what sort of numbers am i expecting

well i know that between my front and

rear motors i have a total of just over

400 brake horsepower

that's got to shove along well over 2.1

tonnes

but despite that Polestar claims this

will do not to 60 in a very respectable

4.7 seconds but i'm not going to take

their word for it

and here we go

not even a fizz of wheel spin

that's 60 miles an hour already it's

arrow straight

a lot of wind noise already and boom

there's 100 miles an hour

more than my goodness that was

incredibly linear very undramatic

it's exactly how you'd expect

accelerating in a fast electric car

to be let's bring it to a stop before we

run out of runway

oh those brakes are powerful and i have

some results for you

so on this ever so slightly damp and

very cold track

we've done naught to 60 in 4.6 seconds

immediately beating

polstar's claim by a tenth and not to

100 miles an hour in 11.4 seconds that

feels pretty respectable

for a volvo ish saloon to me meanwhile

the quarter mile for all you stateside

fans

13.26 seconds at 103.4

miles an hour polstar claimed this is a

performance car

and it has well the performance

is it comfy so let's have a little think

about this

performance pack shall we yes we've got

20-inch

forged wheels they save 1.2 kilos per

corner and that's got to be good for the

ride but of course

the headline act is sweden's finest

suspension

olean's adjustable dampers these are

called

dual flow valve dampers and i won't get

bogged down in how they work now but the

point is they're supposed to

smooth out imperfections when you're

going slowly and deal with big

bumps when you're going quickly but

frankly this Polestar 2 is making a bit

of a hash of it

i just don't understand why a car that's

supposed to be as relaxing as a sauna is

this

firm

[Music]

how big's the battery simple choices

here

the cheaper standard range model has a

64 kilowatt hour battery pack

good for a claimed range of 260 to 270

miles

upgrade to the long range for 3 000

pounds and you score a 78 kilowatt-hour

battery

up in claimed range to around 320 miles

the most of any Polestar 2 adding dual

motor drive to the big battery

bolts 6 000 quid to the price and drops

the range by about

40 miles but you'll get from naught to

60

quickest of all in the real world this

performance pack car is good for about

220 miles between charges

is it practical in the back there's

enough

room for adults to sit behind actual

adults though it doesn't feel

quite as roomy as a conventional saloon

because of that narrow glass

the boot isn't gargantuan but 405 liters

should be fine for most things

and because it's a proper hatchback

unlike their tesla model 3's pokey

saloon tailgate the opening is huge

your boot space isn't invaded by

charging cables either

as they're either stored in a separate

locker under the bonnet

or a secret cubby hole beneath the boot

floor

what does it weigh now underneath the

Polestar is actually based on a volvo

xc40

and that's built to withstand head-on

collisions with fully grown elk so

we're not expecting this to be a light

car folks polstar claims

this spec should weigh in at 2123 kilos

but this one's coming at 2148.

now that does make it 200 kilograms

heavier than the tesla model 3 that i'm

already bored of mentioning

what's it like on a motorway well for

the most part it's perfectly pleasant

but there are just a couple of niggles

the first of which is this tour ride now

i've been trying but

i really can't get my head around this

performance pack yes it's great to have

designer label olene's dampers but

really how many people are gonna spend

fifty 000

quid on an electric saloon car and then

slide underneath it at seven o'clock

every morning

to dial in their favorite settings with

an allen key

i'd just rather have a great big comfort

plus button

right in the middle of the touchscreen

right now the other issue is

we're cruising at just over 80 miles an

hour right now but even if i knock it

back down to her majesty's approved

70 there's just a touch too much

wind noise around the mirrors and a lot

of tire raw coming

from these big 20-inch rims using some

top gear mats however

i think we might be able to solve this

nope it's still pretty taut and it's

even louder

there is a weird thing to do with the

top speed of this car as well which i am

now doing

in fact i've gone past it Polestar

claims this car will top out at 127

miles an hour

but i've got 128 maybe even 129.

now that's strange for a very good

reason

you see volvo recently limited all their

cars to 112 miles an hour because that's

safer

and it's better for the environment now

we know that electric cars don't like

doing big top speeds it absolutely

wrecks

the battery range but polestar have

allowed this car

to go all the way to 127 miles an hour

for absolutely no reason i can think of

what's it like in a corner

well everything feels pretty much out of

the modern electric car playbook i've

got

accurate but slightly synthetic feeling

steering

though i can adjust that through light

standard and firm

settings on the touchscreen of course

and with all the weight down low

and concrete dampers there's no such

thing

as body roll so let's try something a

little bit faster

can you really start cracking on in one

of these Polestar 2s

you discover that they've actually

properly developed

a sporty handling car i mean a tesla

doesn't feel like that a tesla feels

more like a computer game

this is a car you can almost adjust with

throttle and brake and

being a bit aggressive with the steering

now i don't think i'll be setting a

4am alarm on a sunday morning to go for

a country lane blast in one of these

but once a week i might cut my commute

short come off the motorway two

junctions early

and just enjoy a decent handling chassis

if i owned a Polestar 2 there's not many

other evs

that i could say that about really so

what about range

well i can't quite give you our normal

here's the number of miles we've done

and here's what i've got left in the

battery today

and there's a very good reason for that

polstar makes its own rules when it

comes to charging

and it recommends that you don't charge

a Polestar 2 past 90

to protect the long-term health of the

battery so we began today with a 90

charge and about 180 miles

now i have tested one of these before

with a full battery and found that on a

full charge you're likely to get around

220 miles

so that is what you should aim for

what's the verdict well if you're a

total eevee

noob then you'll find quite a lot to

like about this Polestar 2.

polestar seems to have got its design

stick nailed on the outside

the interior works seamlessly though i

do wonder if

apple fans will like a car with

google android os built in

hmm it's certainly one of the keener

handling electric cars you can buy for

around this budget and it's certainly

not lacking in performance either

ultimately you could compare this in

some ways to the honda e

this is so good looking it's so

desirable and it's so

different it says such great things

about your sense of

taste and style that you'll find

yourself wanting one

even if the pragmatic numbers don't add

up quite as nicely

as you'd hoped they would

you
