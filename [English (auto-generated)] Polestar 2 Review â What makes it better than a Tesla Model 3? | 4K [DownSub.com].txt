hi

i'm richard from drive green and today

we're going to be spending a bit of time

with the Polestar 2.

the Polestar 2 of course is Polestars

and the volvo group's

first fully electric car now the volvo

group and Polestar have very grand

plans in the full electrification of

their cars

uh taking place ahead of a lot of

manufacturers so i've been really

excited to spend some time with this car

and see what the future holds from the

swedish manufacturer

whilst in all our reviews i really do

want to just look at the Polestar 2

and how it is in a car in its own right

however it's hard not to compare against

the model 3

tesla since you can certainly argue that

it's perhaps the obvious alternative to

this giant in the ev world

hopefully in the short video i can point

out perhaps some of the key factors with

the Polestar as to why you might choose

it and might make it the right ev for

you

whether you're looking at a tesla model

3 or not

[Music]

polstar is volvo's performance sub brand

and it's the first part of the volvo

group to now be producing fully electric

vehicles

the Polestar 2 follows on from the

hybrid polestar one

which always felt like kind of a concept

vehicle

very expensive and of niche appeal and

assembled from the existing volvo parts

bin

polstar 2 however is the real deal with

a ground-up design

produced with sort of commitment and in

enough numbers to mean the price is

fairly competitive while certainly

competitive enough to make it a real

contender within the mainstream ev

market

albeit towards the middle to top end of

it

launched in 2020 it's still a recent

entrant into the market

however it does hint towards a very

exciting future from the brand

style wise is where i think the polestar

really wins and i think it looks a key

in particular when you're judging it

against the tesla model 3.

i think it's a really great looking car

it's masculine with a hint of muscle car

about it

it's kind of got a hint of the old

fastback mustang about it

in fact it's how i always imagined an

electric mustang would look until the

mackie was released

this full width light bar at the back i

think looks absolutely great

it immediately creates intrigue with the

car i remember the first time i ever saw

a Polestar it was from behind and i

wasn't sure if it was a Polestar

but it was this light bar that caught my

eye as the car just sped away from me

the front has a slightly aggressive

serious look about it

with nice clean lines and a lack of over

fussiness

it's got a slightly high riding stance

as well that says i mean business

yeah there's some nice design features

like these frameless wing mirrors here

subtle i know but i think we forget how

often we spend our time looking in the

wing mirrors of the car and i think it's

quite nice that they've

put some design focus there i think this

is a great looking car

and definitely better looking and more

eye-catching than tesla model 3.

in fact i go as far as to say i think

it's better looking than most cars out

there

i guess this is what you'd call a

compact executive saloon and it's a very

nicely medium sized car

the boot size is good and whilst it's a

touch smaller in volume than the tesla

model 3

the fact it is a hatchback means it's

better at accepting awkward sized loads

the Polestart actually approved to toe

you can also fit a roof box on so it can

still fulfill some practical roles like

the family holiday

there's plenty of room in the front of

the car there's lots of leg room in the

rear also

although i fancy headroom might be a

little bit tight for your taller

passengers

it's a pity there's this lump in the

back here which i'd imagine is a little

bit of a pain when you've got three

passengers in the rear but i'd imagine

that's only going to be occasional

my biggest criticism of the car actually

is how tight the opening is getting in

and out of these rear seats

it's rather a tight opening and it's

been designed more for style and as a

result

it's a little bit awkward getting in and

out

in terms of styling quality they've done

a really nice job on the interior as

well

it's very modern and premium nice crisp

design

quite quite simple quite minimalist you

could argue it's a little bit on the

blind side

however the materials are good and the

build quality

is excellent

these sport seats are nice and comfy and

very supportive

in line with their pursuit of producing

a zero carbon car

polstar of favored vegan interiors so

the bulk the seating options are fabric

such as this dark gray one here

there is a napa leather option for the

car as well in case you want the car to

have that more traditional premium look

and feel about it

but there are some nice stylish touches

as well like the contrasting fabrics

you've got these nice sort of wood

accents on the dash

and i do like the very interesting shape

gear selector that's also illuminated as

well with the polestar symbol in it all

very nice

up you've got this really nice touch

screen that provides most of the

controls for the car

it might be nice to have a few more

physical buttons just to satisfy the

sort of traditionalist amongst us

something perhaps the heating controls

would be nice you do get this rather

lovely pretty button that is here very

nicely designed however it um

it controls the stereo system which of

course you control from the steering

wheel so

it might have been nicer to make that

heating control button instead

however i do appreciate how it looks

we've also got this really nice

big digital dash display which is

absolutely lovely

and certainly when you're drawing

comparisons with the tesla model 3

which of course doesn't have a dash

display i think this is a real

big thumbs up for the for the Polestar

the Polestars infotainment system is

the first to be powered by android as

standard

and it really is a nice familiar system

to use

it also has apple carplay if that's your

preferred interface

all in all it's a really nice interior

it's quite minimal

and uncluttered but it's not as starkly

minimal as you get in the tesla model 3

and i think it's definitely fair to say

it's a

more premium build and quality again if

i'm comparing the pulse start of the

model 3 i

much prefer its interior i like the fact

it has a digital dash display

so the polstar is the winner here in

this regard unless you prefer the

complete minimalism the tesla offers

the Polestar 2 is available in two

battery sizes you've got the standard

range and the long range

the standard range gives you a 64

kilowatt hour battery and only comes in

a front-wheel drive

a single motor format that however is

going to give you

i think realistically somewhere in the

region about 230 miles of driving range

of course as always depending on the

time of year and in particular your

driving style

the long range model comes with a 78

kilowatt hour battery and is available

as both a single motor and dual motor

configuration

the more powerfully spec'd and more

powerful dual motor all-wheel drive

models

deliver around about sort of 270 miles

worth of driving range depending of

course on

how fast you like to drive the car the

less powerful single motor version

will do more in the range of around

about 300 miles

which is great and it kind of puts the

the Polestar range wise

you know along there with the best of

them however that extra range that you

get with the single motor version

is very much at the expense of

performance

the single motor models will do nought

to 60

in 7.4 seconds which whilst

that is well it's very quick compared to

most traditional cars

within the ev space that's decidedly

average

the dual motor model however is much

quicker giving naught to 60

in 4.7 seconds which is sports car quick

and blisteringly fast

naturally i think given the choice most

of us would choose to go for the long

range

all-wheel drive model however if

range is your priority you might choose

the long-range single motor version

and you know we're just going to save

about 3 000 pounds

uh however if range is less of an issue

and performance isn't so much of a

problem and

budget is there there's a whole six

thousand pound save by just going for

the

standard range sort of simple motor

version however if your budget will

stretch

to that all-wheel drive long-range model

like the one i'm driving today

you certainly won't be disappointed and

i think you'll consider it money well

spent

drive wise this is a really nice car to

drive

ferocious acceleration it corners really

well handles very very good

and it's very refined in its drive it

definitely does feel like an executive

sport saloon

with that 400 horsepower motor it does

make it a very fun car to drive

its drive really does suit its looks it

is an electric muscle car and is

incredibly enjoyable to be behind the

wheel of

in terms of driving controls you've got

two different levels of regen braking

which is nice

i've been flicking between both low

regen and high regen depending on

the sort of sporty style i've been

driving in it's nice to have both of

them there

and it's very nice to have this high

regen setting so you can enjoy

uh that one pedal driving style that's

so quintessential about the ev

you've also got auto hold and you can

also set the car to either creep like a

traditional automatic car

or not depending on what you prefer it's

drive and it's adjustable drive settings

are everything you would expect from a

premium ev

and i really like it as standard you've

got a nicely equipped car

you've got 19 inch diamond cut alloys

you've got keyless entry and keyless

starting

heated seats you've got led front and

rear lights

you've got a reversing camera and

sensors front and rear

you've got an auto power liftgate you've

also got this

great android auto based uh infotainment

center

and you've got apple carplay as another

option as well

you've got the plus pack we've got some

nice options in it you've got this

lovely pan roof

you've got an upgraded harman kardon

sound system

you've got the upgraded seats nappa

leather becomes an option

some atmospheric mood lighting a heat

pump based heating system to help extend

your winter range

and you also get a heated steering wheel

and heated rear seats

the plus pack might cost an extra 4k but

there are actually some really nice bits

in this pack

the pilot pack gives you some more sort

of techie driver assistance functions so

you've got your

adaptive led headlights you've got a 360

degree camera system

and you've got the adaptive cruise

control with the steering assist

it's not quite tessa's autopilot however

it will do the accelerating braking and

the steering for you

whilst it isn't something i particularly

enjoy using on high-speed roads or on

the motorway something i find

a really nice feature when i'm stuck in

slow moving traffic for example

and you've got the performance pack

which provides some extra sort of sporty

styling

and some slightly improved handling if

you like driving the car in a

particularly sporty mode

you've got upgraded performance brakes

with gold calipers an upgraded

suspension system

bigger 20 inch diamond cut alloy wheels

and add some nice gold seat belts as

well

add an extra five thousand pounds in

cost though i think you you do need to

question

the importance of this backpack in

particular um

whilst you know it does add some nice

aesthetic upgrades to the car which for

many people

is quite important and it does add some

slight

performance advantages you've already

got a car that looks great

and you've already got a car that

handles really well

whilst having additional spec bundles

together like we do here

helps keep things nice and simple it is

also a little bit frustrating that you

can't spec the actual options you want

and invariably you end up paying more

to have the things you want and paying

for extra spec items

you're not bothered with it's a shame

for example you can't inspect the pan

roof on its own or the heat pump for

example

but there are some nice spec options

here and budget permitting you can build

a car with pretty much every conceivable

spec item there is on the market now the

Polestar 2 is a perfectly capable long

distance driving machine

particularly if you're going for a long

range model uh which can give you up to

about

300 miles worth of driving range which

puts it up there with the best of them

the car is also capable of 150 kilowatt

charging

uh which is great it means that the

right charge point if you're lucky

enough to be able to find one

you're able to charge the car from

roughly empty to roughly full in about

40 minutes which is brilliant

however these 150 kilowatt charges are

quite few and far between

that being said 100 kilowatt charge

points are becoming more and more of a

common sight

so it's good to know that you've got a

car that's capable of charging at these

higher speeds

whilst the polstar 2 is a brilliant car

on its own right it seems inevitable

that it's going to get compared to the

tesla model 3

being they're sort of profiled the same

as sort of mid-size executive saloons

and they've sit at a similar price point

so how does it fare

i think it's reasonable to say that i

think the the Polestar is a better

looking car

it's definitely reasonable to say i

think that the interior is nicer and the

build quality is better

and when it comes to driving performance

they're both very similar

however it's also very important to

remember that the tesla model 3

very much has earned its place as the

most popular ev in the world

the model 3 it's a little bit cheaper

it's got a little bit more range

it's a little bit quicker as well and

the boot is slightly bigger

also has that brilliant autopilot system

which actually is excellent it's going

to be very hard to beat by any

manufacturer

and it has that all-important tesla

supercharger network

which is a very very important factor if

you're someone like a

like a regional sales rep that does an

awful lot of long-distance driving and

requires an awful lot of public charging

and tesla of course is also one of the

coolest brands on the planet right now

however actually i think polstar is

quite a cool brand as well

it may be a sub brand of volvo but it is

a performance sub brand

and it's relatively unknown which gives

the car a certain level of exclusivity

that the model 3 doesn't have

and it's this exclusivity that comes

with the Polestar which i think

is the secret and the key to why you

would choose a Polestar 2 over the tesla

model 3.

the polestar is a great looking really

cool car whereas the tesla model 3

isn't much of a head turner and as a

result it's incredible popularity you

see absolutely loads of them out there

and as a result of which

becoming such a common site on the road

the tesla model 3 is

fast becoming the new ford mondeo and

whilst this won't matter to a great many

people who are quite happy to

follow the crowd and blend in if you're

someone who likes a certain amount of

individuality

likes your car to stand out from the

crowd a little bit and like to be a bit

of a non-conformist

uh then the Polestar 2 is definitely the

car for you and you won't be

disappointed with the Polestar 2

it's a great looking car it's really

well made

it performs really well it's really fun

to drive

and it's got that level of exclusivity

that makes you feel

quite special really and that's the

reason why if i had to choose between

the two cars

it would be the Polestar 2 for me if

you're looking for a medium-sized

long-range ev

that looks great stands out from the

crowd and it's got sports car

performance

and i think it's definitely worth taking

a look at the Polestar 2.

helping you find out a little bit more

about the Polestar 2.
