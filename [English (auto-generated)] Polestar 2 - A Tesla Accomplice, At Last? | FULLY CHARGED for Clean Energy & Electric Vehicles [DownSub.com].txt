we're starting our journey in a very

appropriate

place for this car the dalesford organic

farm shop uh in oxfordshire

which is exquisite and beautiful

beautiful

food uh has

charges in the car park um you know it's

exquisite it's

it's a it's a middle-class fantasy world

and in a way that's entirely appropriate

for this car because this car

is exquisite it's

vegan it's organic it's fabulous

it is really really

beautiful i'm slightly overwhelmed and

i'm going to get over it so

this is the Polestar 2 and this

is fully charged

[Music]

[Music]

so what i'm going to be talking about

today in this car

is absolutely specific all i am going to

do is compare this car

to the tesla model 3. so this is

fabulous and the

the reason it's it's comparable to the

tesla model 3 will become obvious as we

rattle through the stats i have now

driven

hundreds of different cars including

pretty much every electric car that is

currently available and some that will

be available very shortly

so i've had a very wide experience of

that now i'm not saying i am a high-end

professional driver i'm definitely not

i'm just a very experienced driver i

have spent

tens of thousands of hours behind a

steering wheel

in my life and i've driven all over the

world left-hand-drive,

right-hand-drive and out of all those

cars i've driven

and this is quite i find this quite hard

to say

out of all those cars i've driven i

actually think

this is

very close to the best one i've ever

driven

it is truly truly impressive

the human machine interface on the

Polestar 2

is is is

way out ahead it's better than any other

car

including tesla now i know this because

i've driven a tesla model 3

for 12000 miles i've driven a tesla

model s for

80000 miles i know tesla's very very

well

this car's interface

is exquisitely well done it's simpler

it's not as

you know it's not as quirky it's android

you'll be able to use this

the moment you get in you'll find out

the menus are all really clear

wait how you control the car how you

change settings in the car

there's a manual on there which tells

you how to do it in case you're not sure

it took me seconds to get used to

driving this car it was

absolute doddle it is built in china

with chinese components it's got chinese

batteries

it has a chinese drivetrain it is a

chinese car

it is a hundred percent chinese but the

brand

Polestar is is a it was the performance

car brand of

volvo before volvo was owned by

a chinese company so Geely bought volvo

in 2010.

there's a really important caveat i

think and a really interesting

thing so when we featured the uh

xiaopeng p7

and the aura one or whatever the little

chinese car that

elliot richards reviewed for us in china

we got a lot of

comments and some quite abusive and

nasty ones

about the fact that people wouldn't buy

it because it was chinese

uh and they would never buy anything

that was chinese and

you know there was a whole thing about

you know huawei the chinese government

hong kong

all those things about china you know a

lot of criticism like that

and i couldn't help but i did reply to

some of the people i tried to be polite

and

kind to say i'm just intrigued as to

what

technology you're using to make this

comment

because no doubt it is using a piece of

electronics

that is uh made in china so now um

we're going up a hill and making sure

that there's no one in the way

now that that is impressive

acceleration if someone who's never been

an electric car is your passenger and

you've got one of these and you want to

show off

they will be impressed by its power and

its speed

so here's a nice bend that i would

actually take

slightly slower in a tesla just does not

care

just is not bothered it's quite a hard

ride as other people have mentioned

it's not a sort of luxury smooth ride

it's got quite a firm

ride but it's so so confident

and there's a tesla model 3 going the

other way

which looks really interesting now

because i think aesthetically

and i know this will annoy a lot of

tesla people

i think aesthetically i prefer this to

the model 3 and yet i

absolutely adore driving my model 3. i'm

not going to denigrate the tesla model 3

in any way i think it's the best car

tesla ever made

and it's the best electric car on the

market at the moment until this arrived

and now it's debatable and it really

depends on your

uh aesthetic sense and one

other vitally important thing so in

every respect this car is

so close to the tesla model 3 it's

comical and possibly not accidental

[Music]

so the Polestar 2 can go from 0 to 60

miles an hour or about 100 kph in 4.7

seconds 4.7 the tesla model 3

all-wheel drive long range that's the

one i drive can do

naught to 60 or 100 kph in 4.6 seconds

it's one of a second faster the tesla is

than this

the Polestar 2 has a top speed of 130

miles an hour

or 209 kph the tesla model 3 has a top

speed of 145 miles an hour

or 233 kph so the tesla is a little bit

faster

you could lose your license a little bit

quicker the Polestar 2 has a range of

240 miles or 390 kilometers

the tesla model 3 has a range of 280

miles or 450 kilometers

the Polestar 2 costs 46 900 pounds

and the tesla model 3 costs 46

990 pounds

but those comparisons i think are

absolutely extraordinarily close

so there is one one problem

on one thing that sets this car apart

from the tesla model 3.

so it's a chinese car but it is entirely

reliant

on a european charging network which i

am going to say

very clearly is improving at an

astronomical rate

but it is discombobulated

it is hundreds of different suppliers

with hundreds of different arrangements

all over the place so for that extra 90

pounds that you're paying for a tesla

model 3

you can drive if you're in europe

anywhere in europe if you're in the

north america

anywhere in north america if you're in

china pretty much anywhere

in china and it's so

easy to use you don't need a tag you

don't need membership the car knows so

you drive up to a charger you plug it in

and it starts

charging there is nothing else to do

so that is what sets this car apart if

you buy this car you will not be

disappointed

it is brilliant there was a time when

every single automotive journalist would

go you know there's something something

or other tesla killer no

no this is a brilliant competitor for

the tesla this will

shake tesla up it will make them try

harder to make their cars better because

this

is a bloody good it really really is

[Music]

amazing

[Music]

look at this car it's beautiful it is

beautiful

i just i'm really impressed with it so

but here we have

a classic example of what i was talking

about as regards the tesla model 3 and

the Polestar 2 or indeed any other

vehicle

over here we have four beautiful ionity

charges recently installed

one of them works three of them have

failed

so that's what i was going to charge it

over there i've come over here to where

the polars are

they all work hats off to polar they are

really working hard to make sure their

charges

work you don't have to have a membership

you don't have to do anything you just

tap your card

and you plug it in and it works so it's

charging now

that is that is critically important if

you're using this car to drive all

around the place

i am charging this at about 50 kilowatts

now if i was charging over there

this car can charge at 120 kilowatts so

i would get a much faster charge

over there i mean today it doesn't

matter i just want to point out to

people who might not have driven an

electric car this is for show purposes

only absolutely do not need to charge

this car to get to where i'm going now

and then to get home it's it's a doddle

so i'm only driving about 130 miles

today

well within the range of this vehicle

but let's just have a look at it because

it is

i do think it is a beautiful car every

aspect of it

so that has a sort of frunk with the

charging cables in i mean that is great

having somewhere else put your carb

charging cables if they're in the back

and then you put a load of baggage on

then you need to plug it in you've got

to get

you know normal story so that is

reasonable not that big i mean you can

get a bit of shopping in there you get a

small

laptop in there i suppose but it's

basically to put the cables in

screen wash that's really all you ever

need to know where do you put the screen

wash

that's nice that just closes that's good

like that

so the wing mirrors a lot of people have

raved about the wing mirrors because

they have no

uh edge around them the glass goes to

the edge which is

okay not something that really

profoundly excites me the wheels

yes so when it arrived at my house there

were two builders working on a house the

other side of the lane to me

the first thing they said is oh look at

the calipers

they love the calipers so the bronze

brake calipers clearly have a

slightly fetishistic quality to them

there's one thing i want to show you

which i think is

it's small but it's important

so i've got the key in my pocket i've

got shopping i'm going to mime it

a load of shopping come round to the

back

and i put my foot under there

under there

let me try again so i've got my shopping

come on

and then i go

who knows i might never be able to open

this again

so the back of this is slightly smaller

i've read than the tesla model 3. i

can't really tell it's not that much

difference but what is nice it's a big

flat space really flat floor a little

side pocket there

but what is what i really like this

thing oh

there now that you go what's the point

of that it's got two little hooks there

is you put your shopping in there if you

haven't got a load of shopping and

filling up the whole thing

it means it's not going to be flying

around it's held in place by that little

flap

but this is what knocked me out

underneath there

massively extra space you could get a

lot of luggage in that

so this i think is better better

than the tesla model 3 not as good not

comparable better these lines

all these joins here up here

on the roof all the way around the doors

are exquisitely accurate you can tell

they are millimeter accurate you know

really

micron accurate it's so well built

so i mean i can't even sum up because

it's just there's no way of summing up

in one way it's a it's an emotional

i'm having an emotional response to this

car i absolutely

beep beep not suitable for children love

it it is

a an amazing achievement it really is

the it's right at the very

top of any electric vehicle i drive a

tesla model 3 i honestly think this is

as good

in every aspect except public charging

that's the only that's the really the

big advantage that says has but this car

just looks gorgeous it goes like stink

if you want it to it also drives very

sensibly

with uh you know sipping energy

considering its size and the power

behind it

this is gonna sell people are going to

buy this people will want this car

people who can afford a tesla model 3

have a choice now

have quite a lot of choices i mean you

get to go for an i-pace which they're

selling loads jagger are doing very well

with the i-pace and rightly so but this

is going to do

really good business um we are very

proud

fully charged of our independence we do

not get uh

sponsored by any big companies or

anything like that we are entirely

dependent on the generosity

grateful
