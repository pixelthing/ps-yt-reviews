if you're in the market for a premium

all-electric long-range sports sedan

it's pretty hard to beat the tesla model

3. this vehicle has been the

best-selling electric vehicle in the u.s

and across the world for years in fact i

actually owned one for two years it made

me a huge believer in all electric cars

however what if you like the model 3 but

you don't want to drive a tesla because

everybody has been driving a tesla well

that's where a viable alternative like

this comes into play this is the 2022

Polestar 2. it's built off of a volvo

architecture because volvo is the parent

company and just like the model 3 it's

offered in a four-door sedan

configuration which is technically a

hatchback it starts around 46 000 offers

up to 265 miles of range and if you guys

go for the dual motor version with the

performance package you should be

getting to 16 around four seconds so if

you guys are looking for a premium

all-electric sport sedan that's built by

a legacy automaker manufacturer how does

the brand new 2022 pulse stars 2 stack

up stay tuned to find out

[Music]

so being that this is an all-electric

sports sedan the million-dollar question

of course with a lot of eevee

enthusiasts is does this vehicle have a

frunk well

thankfully you will not be disappointed

because polestar seems to have listened

to what eevee buyers want and this

particular one here does have a small

frunk which is a little bigger than its

sister car that i last tested which was

the volvo xc40 now as you can see i like

the way that polestar has finished off

the trunk it's really nicely well

integrated and you can also fit roughly

1.6 cubic feet of stuff that's not

really a lot of space i think the teslas

offer a little bit more room if you lift

this up you can see there's your

fix-a-flat kit or you can also access

the front tow hook this has basically

space to put some of your leftover

take-out food or you can put the

mobile charger in here but roughly let's

talk about the powertrain because we're

underneath the hood all Polestars are

of course all electric there's a new

front-wheel drive single uh motor

version for 2022. that is not the

version that i have here instead i have

the dual motor which has two

electric motors one at the front one at

the back that gives you all-wheel drive

each motor roughly makes 204 horsepower

combined they make 408 horsepower and

487 pound-feet of torque that's roughly

six more horsepower versus its sister

vehicle the volvo xc40 recharge and this

vehicle weighs in at around 4 600 4700

pounds so it's a little bit lighter than

the xc 40. now performance is pretty

impressive polestar says you'll get to

60 in around 4.45 seconds it probably

will end up being a little bit quicker

than that in my real world testing which

we'll talk about when we go on to the

road and it all goes out through a

single speed reduction gear transmission

so it's a one-speed transmission that's

pretty much the norm here with these

all-electric cars now range of course

that's the million dollar cl question

this particular one here will go a

maximum of 249 miles the rear the front

wheel drive version the single motor

will do about 265 Polestar did improve

the range by about 16 miles this year

and they did that through software

changes where they made the motors a

little bit more efficient we are still

using a 78 kilowatt hour battery pack so

roughly the same size battery pack as a

model three and in terms of charging

this will charge at 11 uh kilowatts on

its onboard charger which will basically

allow you to fully charge this vehicle

overnight on a level two in about eight

hours or you can also dc fast charge

this vehicle at 155 kilowatts up to that

and where you can roughly go from 10 to

80 percent in about 30 minutes so very

impressive range figures and the

performance is very impressive as well

when you shut the hood and look at the

styling of the Polestar 2 you can see

this is a very very attractive vehicle i

especially like this particular one that

i'm showing you it's basically a fully

loaded version it's got the performance

package it's got the plus package it's

got the pilot package it's painted in

the shade of midnight which is a dark

blue color i do wish that polestar

offered like a little bit more brighter

colors on this vehicle or how about a

really nice green to go with the fact

that this is an electric car but you can

see the front end is very volvo-esque

you have of course the signature thor's

hammer full led which Polestar even

puts a badge there in the headlights

that says pixel technology these are led

low and high beams it's got adaptive

headlights auto high beams led turn

signals you even got these fog lights

here when you guys go for the plus

package and the grille as you can see

it's pretty unique looking i like the

Polestar badge a lot of people look at

this badge and they don't know what it

is although if you stare at it from

certain angles you can probably tell if

you're an enthusiast or at least a volvo

enthusiast that this is a volvo remember

this is built off of the cma compact

modular architecture that say this the

same platform that underpins the xc40 so

technically this platform is built to

accommodate an internal combustion

engine it has been heavily modified of

course to accommodate the fact that this

is all electric now having the

performance package means that you have

these gorgeous 20-inch wheels with this

kind of machined black finish and the

performance package includes olen

dampers which allow you to adjust them

manually if you get underneath here you

have 22 different settings you also get

these brembo brakes with the gold

calipers gold painted calipers and you

have the gold valve stem caps which

again makes this vehicle stand out in a

very good way in terms of the ground

clearance this is a sedan but it kind of

almost looks like a um like a raised

sedan you have roughly 5.9 inches of

ground clearance which isn't a lot

remember this vehicle is all-wheel drive

and its overall length at around 180.8

inches long is about 7.5 off one inches

longer versus the xc40 so this is

technically the bigger vehicle it rides

on a similar sized wheelbase i also like

the silhouette you can see the plus

package includes this all glass

panoramic roof which doesn't actually

open but it lets in a lot of light and i

also like how polestar has blacked out a

lot of the chrome accents you typically

find on some other vehicles now looking

at the rear you can see the design is

pretty distinctive looking the led tail

lights do a distinctive sequential

sequential dance which is nice you have

led turn signals you have this full

light bar that goes across you have the

Polestar badge which is body colored

which is really interesting looking and

then down here you can see nicely

integrated parking sensors you have a

black plastic area there which looks

pretty

invisible in this darker blue exterior

color and then the cool thing about the

polestar too it looks like a sedan but

it's actually a hatchback so you push

this little button here it's got a power

liftgate which is nice and then when you

open up the liftgate area you get

roughly 16 cubic feet of space that's

matching that of most sedans

and because it's electric you have this

nifty little divider that pops up

in the floor and you also have some nice

underfloor storage which you can see

will easily house the mobile charger or

you can also put it in the front no

spare tire in this vehicle and you can

also drop down those seats and you can

expand the cargo area to about 38 cubic

feet of space so this is more practical

versus a tesla model 3 but not quite as

practical as volvo's xc40 recharge or a

tesla model y

the charge port is also right here on

the driver's side toward the rear you

can see it comes with a standard j1772

plug and for those of you who want a dc

fast charge it comes standard with the

combo ccs adapter which will allow you

to dc fast charge this vehicle at up to

kilowatts so when it comes time to get

in and drive your Polestar 2 let's

first talk about actually getting into

the vehicle just like a tesla polestar

does offer a phone as a key feature and

they also offer an activity key i don't

have the activity key on me but the

activity key is kind of like what jaguar

and land rover do it's designed to get

wet it's a lot smaller or you can also

use the standard key fob which looks a

lot like a volvo key although they put a

lot cheaper plastics on it the volvo key

will wrap it in the same kind of leather

material you can see there's the pole

star badge the buttons are on the side

this key fob is a little bit larger than

i would like it to be and i don't like

how it's not covered in the same leather

material now when you open the door it's

got as you can see conventional door

handles i kind of wish polestar had done

something a little bit more special what

i do like however is the design of the

side mirrors you can see very very thin

border around the actual glass

opening up the cabin or the door you can

see the interior of my particular tester

has this charcoal basically black weave

tex recycled material this is made from

recycled materials this interior is

roughly what you get on this high option

version if you guys want real cowhide

polestar does offer it because uh for

about four thousand dollars you can get

real

blonde napa leather which is a really

nice leather with ventilated seats these

seats are heated and they offer a

two-person memory feature but again

spend four grand if you guys want the

real leather this is the vegan option

for those of you who prefer not to have

real leather the door panel you can see

has this interesting textured material

which is slightly padded you have an

aluminum door handle here i like the

speaker covers here this has the 13

speaker harman kardon stereo which

sounds good and you can see a lot of the

switch gears and controls come from a

volvo because remember this is their

parent company the seats adjust in like

12 different ways they don't offer any

massage or ventilation on this model

here but you can get the ventilation

like i said if you guys go for the

upgraded napa leather now getting inside

this vehicle has a traditional sedan

step in height so those of you who are

hoping it'd feel like more like an suv

i'm sorry to say probably go for the

xc40 recharge if you want that as i shut

the door

the door has a nice solid sounding funk

so that gives me a great impression of

quality which is something that you

don't typically get

of course with a tesla now just like a

tesla as you get into this car and sit

your butt into the seat there's no start

stop knob or button here instead the car

just uses a sensor in the seat and it

senses the key or your phone or the

activity key in here and as i put my

foot on the brake and put the vehicle

into gear that's what turns everything

on and you can hear there's the polestar

chime which is pretty similar to the

last volvo that i was in

and overall it's a pretty nice looking

cabin the one thing that you're going to

notice right away is the all digital

display you have a 12.3 inch digital

display here and you have an 11.2 inch

digital display here which is a touch

screen this is their new google-based

operating system it's an entirely

android-based operating system which if

you guys have an android or google

account you can essentially sign in and

it's designed to be an extension not

even an extension of your phone it's

designed to pair up or be a separate

phone for you when you load up all your

contacts and whatnot currently right now

this this does not have

apple carplay which will be wireless it

also doesn't have satellite radio

polestar promises it'll be in an

over-the-air update that's coming by the

end of this year they're saying fall

2021 still sadly don't have it so

because i don't have car carplay or i

don't have satellite radio there's am

and fram and then there's the bluetooth

media which you can still pair your

phone via bluetooth and pair all your

music to whatnot there's two usb c

charging ports here which i like the way

this looks there's a wireless phone

charger pad right there which barely

fits my iphone 12 pro max and then you

can see the map interface is google maps

this is all very easy to use very

similar to the last xc40 recharge that i

drove there's even a dedicated home

button down here if you push that or tap

that right there where that little white

line is it takes you back to the home

screen now of course going over and

looking at the rest of the home screen

features you can see pushing the car

icon there will allow you to change your

drive mode functions you can change the

steering feel put the stability control

into a sport mode and activate and

deactivate your one pedal drive and the

creep function

going over here you can also adjust the

driver assistance function you can

adjust the charge polestar allows you to

put a maximum level for the charge and

then go to more here it shows you all

your different sources and adjustments

what not it's all very nice looking this

actually looks a lot better versus the

xc40 recharge that i drove like a month

ago

i like the way this looks tapping this

icon here shows you all your different

apps and it allows you to go to your

settings page where you can adjust all

your different settings and whatnot this

also includes over-the-air updates um so

it's a really nice system it's snappy

it's responsive you also have voice

commands where you can say hey google

and it'll hear that find me in the

nearest starbucks

which again works pretty well there

they find me the nearest starbucks

um it works actually better than the

volvo xc40 recharge so this is great if

you guys are really a big fan of android

and google you're going to feel at home

here i just wish that it already had

carplay wireless carplay integrated into

the system now over here on this screen

you can see you can put the map display

in this screen which again looks pretty

good this is what it looks like if you

don't have the map display it shows you

your digital speedo it shows you your

battery power indicator i'm at 79 and

unlike the volvo it has a range distance

to empty meter 180 miles of range i love

how Polestar is doing that i don't know

why the xc40 does not have that

this is all logical information and like

a tesla you have a nice instrument panel

here right behind the steering wheel now

speaking of the steering wheel you can

see it's wrapped in

leather it's got nice stitching it's a

tilt telescoping which is manual offers

a lot of adjustability you have a lot of

buttons here for your controls the horn

sounds very typical

of the size of this vehicle so it's a

nice satisfying horn the vents you can

see very similar to the last volvo

products although these vents here are a

little too high and they don't really

blow air toward my face very well so

again that's something a little bit of a

nitpick the wood trim in here looks

really nice this is a matte finish gray

wood it's also on the dash you have more

of that fabric-like material on the

dashboard this is a soft touch injection

molded plastic which has the same

texturized almost recycled material

finish as you get in the door panels

nice headliner on the actual headline or

on the

on the roof or ceiling of this vehicle

and the seats you can see

similar design to a lot of volvos it's

nicely padded don't like the weave text

it feels like cheap cloth would probably

go for the leather

um this shifter here is interesting when

you uh basically it works like the

shifters in the t8 volvos you have to

push all the way forward to go to drive

kick it back to go to or to reverse kick

it back to go to drive uh and then push

the p button here i like how this is a

really interesting design where it's

see-through or it goes right through

there's a pass-through there's also a

really cool poststar badge that lights

up when you put the vehicle into reverse

you can see there's your backup camera

it offers a full 360 camera it takes up

the entire screen which looks good uh

like the way the camera looks the

resolution is good so can't really

complain there polstar is doing a great

job

with that tech department once they

again give us that wireless apple

carplay and satellite radio a volume

knob over here where you have quick

access to your hazards your front and

rear defogger there's a little bit of

storage on this side and there's also a

little storage on this side but you only

get one cup holder here the other cup

holder is in the center console which is

a little stupid location for it so this

design here does compromise space this

also slides forward to give you a better

armrest i don't like the material in

here it just feels kind of cheap and

scratchy not my cup of tea above me you

can see big glass roof there's no

retractable sun sunshade which i wish it

had that but it is very dark tinted uh

this is part of the plus package this

does this also doesn't open but it's

very nice to look at it's all again a

very well finished beautiful led

lighting in the cabin there's even

uh led lighting of course in the mirrors

and then looking at the glove

compartment you can see it's a bin style

it's damped not lined with felt but it

is a very big glove compartment so that

makes up for the lack of storage space

in the center console so overall

interior definitely has a scandinavian

swedish finish to it i like all i like

all the recycled materials i like the

large screens once they add apple

carplay it'll definitely be one of my

favorite interiors in the segment and it

just has a very modern easy to use feel

now unlike the polestar one which was

only offered as a coupe the Polestar 2

is only offered as a four doors which

means you do have a much more practical

vehicle here and in terms of the rear

seat legroom it's pretty class

competitive to its main competitor the

tesla model 3. now you can see opening

up the back door the door i'm noticing

doesn't open up quite as large as i'd

like it to

but pulstar says you get roughly 33.4

inches of legroom record or 33.9 i'm

sorry so just under 34 inches of legroom

i love how these gold seat belts are

again carried over because this has the

performance package the weave tex

interior still isn't my favorite same

material at the back here but as i get

in you do have to duck your head a

little bit because of this low roof line

but when i get in and shut the door you

can see legroom space is okay at 34

inches at five foot seven i am

relatively comfortable back here you

also have two map pockets on both sides

you have rear seat air vents you have

heated rear seats with three levels and

your own set of two usbc charging ports

which is nice materials are all pretty

much the same as the front i like the

speaker grille covers with the harman

kardon stereo and then you also have

this little armrest here that folds down

and gives you two cup holders so again

this is pretty comparable to the last

model 3 that i had my own in terms of

space but just know that there are other

electric vehicles that give you a smidge

more rear seat legroom

so after having owned a tesla model 3

performance for two years i am just

really happy to be driving a true

competitor to the model 3 i've driven

something that competes with the model y

like the volvo xc40 and the mustang maki

and maybe even the volkswagen 94 but i

haven't had a chance to drive the pole

star 2 and Polestar or volvo they've

been busy trying to

increase the appeal of this car they've

made a

lower horsepower less expensive single

motor front drive version available but

the all-wheel drive with the performance

package this is kind of it blurs the

line between a model 3 performance and a

model 3 dual motor long range so let's

go ahead and test out the 0 to 60 here

and see what i can get

[Laughter]

wow

0 to 60 in 4.19 seconds Polestar says

4.4 seconds so

not surprised that this is a little

faster the beauty about evs is when you

put your foot down there's just

instantaneous

thrust this is even quicker than the

xc40 recharge which doesn't surprise me

this car has slightly more horsepower

it's a little bit lighter even though

it's uh a bigger vehicle

it just feels really good and with the

all-wheel drive system it just has all

this grip now i haven't had a chance to

drive the single motor front drive

version of this car yet um i'm hoping

Polestar will send me that later on but

let's go ahead and just i want to do

another 0-60 i want to see if i can

consistently get that number here

oh god there's so much power

all right i got 4.34 seconds there and

that was uh a little bit better start

there so i'm going to take the 4.3

second number it's a very impressive

time this car is fast

and it just has power for days

instantaneously it just makes me giggle

just like my model 3 performance did now

it is not quite as fast as the tesla the

tesla will probably do it

maybe a second faster than this car but

it is quicker than a dual motor long

range non-performance version of the

model 3.

and this one here having the performance

package with the oled and dampers the

brembo front brakes the steering where

you can adjust the steering feel i have

it in its firm setting now it's still a

little too light for my taste even in

firm

but you get a sense that this car

feels like a sport sedan the model 3

does as well

but uh

there's something about this card that

feels good now the olen dampers you can

adjust them in 22 different variations

you have to get underneath the car and

adjust them manually by hand which seems

a little archaic but i believe it's a

characteristic of olen dampers

but in terms of the ride quality i've

read some people can

complain that it's a firm ride if you're

used to the firm ride quality in a model

3 performance this is going to feel

pretty similar in terms of the ride

comfort these summer continental tires

these summer tires are a little noisy

they do have plenty of grip though they

stick

really well to the road

and in terms of just the overall quality

feel of this vehicle i definitely get it

there's not a squeak or rattle anywhere

this interior also feels really

interesting it feels very modern the

same way that the tesla does but it has

also a sense of build quality in here

what i don't like however are these we

tech seats these are like a recycled

material

and they just feel kind of like a cheap

scratchy cloth for four thousand dollars

volvo will give you a nice beautiful

uh blonde colored napa leather with

ventilated seats i probably go for that

as opposed to this i mean this is

probably better for all you vegans

because this is the vegan option but i

just prefer my you know sixty seven

thousand dollar luxury vehicle that's

electric to have a slightly nicer feel

to the cabin and uh this is just a

little too dark for my taste so i'd

probably go for that uh in terms of the

visibility the rear the view out of the

back is terrible that rear view window

is just awfully small

so the model 3 gives you better

visibility there but

god this thing is so fast so bloody fast

and i love the one pedal drive feature

it's very similar to tesla if i lift my

foot off the accelerator here the car

basically will come to a stop almost

like almost a full stop

and it works really well you can adjust

that of course there's an offsetting

here i'll go into offsetting it just

cruises like any other car there's a low

setting which gives you a little bit of

regen braking and then the standard

gives you a lot of regen picking i think

up to 3g or 0.3 gs of regen braking

which is impressive

and unlike the volvo xc40 recharge that

i tested a month ago the instrument

panel here is a little bit more

customizable you can put the gps there

which is nice but it actually shows me a

range indicator i like that like it

shows me my percentage in the battery

and it also shows me how much range when

they dropped it off it had 85 battery

charge right now it has 80. um so

again it's very close to being fully

charged the performance is very

impressive the seats are also

comfortable if but i don't like the

cloth material this weave text material

but they are comfortable that's a very

volvo-esque you know feel is supposed to

have comfortable seats although again

this is a Polestar there's not a single

you know volvo badge in here even the

the doors or the window glass has pole

star badges you know in addition to

everywhere else around the car

i'll never get tired of that

ooh so much torque i mean almost 500

pound-feet of torque and 408 horsepower

wow i mean could volvo or polestar i'm

sorry i keep saying volvo could polestar

do an even faster version sure they

could give us an extra 100 horsepower

they could put us in model 3 performance

territory

would i like them to do that absolutely

but this right off the bat is going to

be plenty of acceleration and

performance for the majority like 95 of

people even most enthusiasts are gonna

love this as a daily driver

and in terms of the range you know they

say 249 miles 250 miles i got roughly

that mileage in the xc40 recharge

and in this car i got pretty close to

that number as well you could probably

do better if you put this car or you

drive it a little more economically

um you aren't quite as aggressive on the

throttle as i am which is just

intoxicating so i can't help but be a

little more aggressive on the throttle

it does have a little bit less range of

course than the model 3. although i will

say that my model 3 i'm not entirely

sure if tesla's improved that uh in the

most recent 2021 models got right around

270 miles in the real world this does

about 250 miles in the real world so

it's really not that much different my

tester also has a heat pump which is

very important for those of you who live

in those cold weather climates in terms

of driver assistance tech this one here

has the pilot package which is optional

it's 3 200

it includes volvo's driver assistance

features or Polestars driver assistance

features it has their pro pilot assist

system it does a pretty good job it

doesn't change lanes for you though but

it does actively keep you in the lanes

it has blind spot monitoring cross

traffic alert it's got all of the usual

stuff but it is optional although those

of you who have like the launch edition

models you're going to have that as

standard equipment so

there's really little that i can

complain about this car other than the

fact that polstar just doesn't have any

brand recognition i mean i drove this

car for just a couple days and it didn't

really turn as many heads as i thought

it was going to um maybe because it just

looks like a regular volvo on the

outside but people see the badge when

they do see the badge they're like what

the hell is that thing you know i have

to explain oh it's Polestart volvo's

electric performance division which it's

always been their performance division

and now they want to make it electric

instead which is an interesting idea

just because we can i want to floor it

again from a stop

[Laughter]

and that's the beauty about electric

cars so if you're looking for a credible

model 3 alternative that's a sedan

that's also a lift back because remember

you've got the advantage this being a

hatchback this is the one that should be

belonging at the top of your last your

list and keep in mind polestar is adding

more Polestar spaces this year they're

hoping to have 30 spaces around the

country

so

this is definitely a unicorn if you want

to stand out if you don't want to drive

something everyone else has which you

see so many model threes on the road buy

this instead so after spending the last

couple of days with the brand new 2022

Polestar 2 here are my final thoughts on

the vehicle first of all it's a

wonderful credible alternative to a

tesla model 3 that happens to have way

better build quality but it also has

that futuristic modern feel and it has

incredible performance 0-16 around 4.3

seconds is very nice it does roughly 250

miles on a full charge which is pretty

similar to what you'll get in the real

world for a tesla model 3 and my gripes

with the Polestar 2 are few and far

between the back seats a little bit

tight i don't like some of the recycled

materials in the interior which feel a

little bit cheap which you can rectify

by adding the full napa leather and the

infotainment system needs wireless apple

carplay they should have launched it

with wireless carplay it's still coming

by the end of this year but again

polstar is playing catch up there and

it's probably pissing off a lot of early

owners i know it would piss me off the

fact that this does not have that

feature yet but overall it has more

cargo space than the model 3. it kind of

splits the difference between a model 3

and a model y especially if you guys

don't want to drive that ugly model y

you like the shape and the style of a

sedan a lot more this is a really really

great alternative that also has lots of

fast

charging available there's lots of

charging stations available because

electrify america and other other

stations are seriously building their

network up really what it comes down to

with the Polestar 2 is the price this is

more expensive than a tesla model 3. the

base front-wheel drive single motor

version starts at around 46 thousand

dollars plus destination at about three

grand if you guys want the dual motor

all-wheel drive version which starts at

just under fifty thousand dollars my

tester of course here with the plus

package the uh pilot package and the

performance package uh and the extra

cost for the color stickers at around

sixty eight thousand dollars sixty eight

grand makes this roughly ten thousand

dollars more than a model three

performance and it doesn't go quite as

far and it isn't quite as fast so on

paper it's not gonna look great however

if you want something that's not a tesla

and you favor more build quality from a

legacy automation manufacturer and you

want something that's different

i would easily put this at the top of

your list especially once pollstar

eventually adds the wireless apple

carplay feature also keep in mind this

vehicle does qualify for the 7 500 tax

credit which you still cannot get on a

tesla as of this filming so that does

help to lower the bottom line of this

car and it should put it right around

the same price range as a tesla model 3.

but with all that said i hope you guys
