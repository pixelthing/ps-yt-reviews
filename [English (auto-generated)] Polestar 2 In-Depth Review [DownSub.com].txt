welcome to evolution my name is andre

lawrence this is my channel about

electric cars from the perspective of a

first time ev owner and this is the pole

star 2 that Polestar canada lent me for

one week to make a review video about if

you want to find out what i think about

it and what some of the details are

stick around i'll let you know in 10

seconds

[Music]

for the last several months i've been

working with Polestar canada's pr team

to try and get a press car now there

weren't any press cars in canada for

quite some time but now that they've got

a polestar store opened up in laval and

they had some press cars arrive i've

been given the privilege by paul starr

to take one of their cars for a full

week get used to driving it and figure

out all the little details and make a

review video now i was specifically

asked to not make a comparison video of

this car which is kind of like asking

scarface to not do that huge pile of

coke on the table in front of them i'm

really tempted to do what i usually do

but i promised i wouldn't so this video

is going to be what i think of the car

what a lot of the features are

and what i think of it in general

although the Polestar 2 may have the

shape of a sedan it's actually a

hatchback now i think this gives it a

distinct advantage over its competition

the tesla model 3 which isn't with that

being said let's have a look at the

trunk when it comes to opening the trunk

of the Polestar 2 there are no buttons

on the exterior but there are two ways

of doing it the first is with the key

fob there's a button on the key fob you

press and hold and it will open it is a

power liftgate and then there's the what

if you've got your hands full method and

that's simply a matter of kicking

underneath the bumper

once you've opened the trunk there are

actually a few interesting features in

here now the first one is quite simple

but quite ingenious there's a divider to

prevent things from sliding around

because the trunk is quite deep and

we'll put the measurements of the trunk

up here on the screen for you to see let

me show you that divider now

you just have to pull up on this

it snaps into place there is an elastic

and there are some hooks here for bags

or whatever you might want to put on

there so that's actually quite

interesting and i've actually used it

this week thought it was quite cool now

the other interesting feature is that

you can lift this bottom panel up and

there is storage underneath and i'll put

a picture of that up here so you can see

it up close

essentially you lift this

now

it lifts up but what do you do if you

want to go under there well paul star

thought of that there's a little prop

that you can put into place and then get

full access to the space that's

underneath now you've got the level one

or granny charger that's under there and

you can put whatever else you feel might

be interesting

now another feature that is very cool in

here

is a power outlet there is a 12 volt

outlet on this side of the trunk now

that 12 volt outlet can be used for

things like an air compressor or you can

use it for an electric cooler or

whatever else that you might need now

the last feature that i thought was

pretty cool other than the pocket with

the net that's on the other side of the

trunk is a ski pass-through now for this

ski pass-through to work you have to put

the arm rest in the back down and you

need to flip up a little material cover

but let me show you what that looks like

so once that's opened up you can pass

through some skis or if you're brave you

can stick in a 2x4

since this is a hatchback with a giant

opening you can put those split seats

down in the back for some extra cargo

space now there are no latches inside

the trunk to pull them down and have

them go automatically you have to reach

over from the inside of the rear doors

on the top of the seats one on each side

now the Polestar 2 has a traditional

parcel shelf which is a one-piece unit

that's some sort of pressed material i'm

not sure what it is covered in a nice

fabric and it is attached in a

traditional fashion with some wires here

and a couple clips one on each side now

i prefer a retractable parcel shelf or

cargo cover in that case because you can

retract it easily and store it usually

under the floor of the trunk and with

one of these you need to take it out and

find a place for it usually in the house

i wouldn't consider putting it between

the rear seats and the front seats

because it's so large

now let me set this aside and we'll have

a look at the trunk space

with the parcel shelf out of the way the

opening being quite large it allows for

storage of some larger items but does it

stand up to the can i sit in the trunk

test let's find out now as you can tell

from this completely useless test that

i've done in a previous video with my

kia niro ev you can sit in the trunk of

this car and it does have a generous

amount of trunk space especially when

you consider the opening you can fit

something quite large one point to

consider though is that it does have a

sedan shape meaning that the large item

has to stop at the top right here now i

will put the measurements of the

Polestar 2 opening height from here to

the floor as well as the measurement

from the lowest spot to the floor and

then i'll give you the total depth with

these seats down somewhere up here on

the screen for you to see to give you a

better idea i also did the i laid down

in the trunk test and i do fit in it

diagonally i would have to have

something filling in the space behind

the front seat for my head to rest on

but i am only five feet eight and i'll

have that up in here in meters somewhere

so once you're done and you want to

close the trunk there are actually three

ways to do it now the first is to use

the key fob and press and hold the trunk

button the next would be to use the

button that's here on the bottom of the

tailgate and the last way is to do the

same old kick under the bumper trick

that's this right here

and then it starts closing but what if

you want to get in there and you forgot

that you've got something to get out

well you can kick and it'll stop again

unfortunately there's no way that i know

of that allows you to make it go back up

once it's in this position so you're

gonna have to kind of like scoot under

there to grab whatever you need

now with that being said to finish

closing you just kick underneath and the

trunk will continue to close

now for all of this really cool stuff to

work you need the key fob in your pocket

because it is a proximity sensor with

regards to the key fob and the kick

sensor that's underneath the bumper now

what about the front does it have a

frunk yes it does let's go have a look

when i opened the front the first time i

found a couple interesting features let

me open it up and show you what i mean

the latch is on the right side of the

hood it's a little yellow lever

now the hood doesn't latch like regular

cars with one single mounting point in

the middle it's actually got a latch on

each side of the hood actually looks

quite robust now the other thing that's

interesting is this front has an insert

in it to prevent smaller items from

sliding around so you could take this

out if you want to put something that's

a little bit bigger it's also got a tire

mobility kit underneath this little

false floor

and it's got the jack in the top portion

something else that i found interesting

here and i don't have any information on

but i will ask polstar about it see what

they say

right under here under the hood there's

a little symbol in this thing that says

air woofer technology now i don't know

what that is but when i find out i'll

put it in the description below

i've been driving the Polestar 2 for a few

days and there are some features that i

thought were pretty interesting that i

wish they were on my car now on most

cars there is a button on the driver's

side front door as well as on some cars

on the passenger side front door to lock

and unlock the car doors now the Polestar

2 actually does something interesting

they do away with the actual physical

button there's a touch sensitive area

but they put it on all four doors i

thought that was pretty cool because

sometimes you just want to open that

back door you don't have to reach over

to that front one to just unlock the

doors or fiddle with a key fob that's in

your pocket another feature that i

really like about this car is the fact

that you don't even need to press the

button on the door handle to unlock the

doors you can simply stick your fingers

in the opening behind the handle the

doors will sense the key in your pocket

and unlock the doors automatically now

obviously you have to have the key fob

on you for both of those features to

work now speaking of the key fob there

is an interesting feature when you get

into the car and i'll show that to you

very shortly there are a couple last

features on the exterior that i thought

were points to notice

now polestar has decided that there were

no roof rails on the top of the polestar

2 but they've given you an option to

have a roof rack in case you want to put

a bike or you want to put some kayaks up

there and that's to integrate some

mounting points straight into the body

of the car now on both sides of the car

both in front and rear polestar has

added mounting holes that you can bolt a

rack that they sell on their website and

it looks like a toulet product so i'm

guessing it's excellent quality now tule

also seems to sell a product for this

car so you have options if you want one

the last interesting design choice that

Polestar made when making this car was

the fact that the side mirrors are

actually one piece as opposed to having

the mirror in a housing like most cars

that means that this entire body and the

mirror will move when you adjust them

for yourself inside the car now

according to polestar's website this

reduces the size of the side mirror

increasing aerodynamics

one last note the charge port on the

Polestar 2 is on the rear driver's

quarter panel now depending on your

preferences that's a good thing or a bad

thing i think it's a good thing because

having it in the front in the winter is

not so great when there's snow and ice

after driving this Polestar 2 for a few

days i've gotten quite used to the

features and functions of the interior

now some of the things that i really

like are the controls they are based on

android automotive google's operating

system for cars

and being an android user that makes

everything extremely intuitive to use

but with that being said i don't think

anybody who's not using android is going

to feel uncomfortable using this

on the contrary it's actually pretty

intuitive

now there are certain things about the

interior design that are going to be

very subjective and i'm going to tell

you what i personally prefer and not but

that doesn't mean that this is not a

great interior it's actually very well

laid out now this is more of a sedan and

more sporty so you're sitting a little

bit lower to the ground than in what i'm

used to driving and things are a little

bit more closed in and more cockpit like

it makes things easy to reach with that

being said there is something that bugs

me in this car and it's the way the door

card or the doors have the layout for

the grip that you use to close the door

in most cars that i've driven the grip

position is in the horizontal spot of

the door meaning that you reach over and

grab it horizontally and you close the

door

in the case of the Polestar 2 they put the

controls for the windows the door locks

and mirrors

in that position and you have a more

vertical thing to grab to close the door

and every time i get in the car i keep

pressing the buttons now that's very

subjective and it's something that you

would get used to if you drove the car

for a little while longer so i don't

think it's a big issue it's just

something that i noticed when i started

to drive it the other thing i found a

little less convenient when i got in the

car for the first time were the steering

wheel controls now the steering wheel

controls for the cruise control on the

left hand side of the steering wheel are

fine and it took all of five seconds to

figure out but the buttons on the right

hand side well they don't really tell

you what they do other than the google

assistant button so you kind of have to

press and figure it out or you use a

really cool feature that's in the touch

screen and i'll show you that very

shortly another nice detail in the

Polestar 2 is a spot in the center

console in front of the shifter that

allows you to put your cell phones it's

actually a wireless charging pad on the

left and the right hand side has two

usbc ports that are hidden under some

rubber flaps now you can actually put

two cell phones in this location and has

a little divider in the middle that

prevents them from sliding around now

Polestar has decided to keep some

essential items as physical buttons in

the center console and i think this is a

fantastic feature because i hate digging

through sub menus to find some basic

things like front and rear defrost now

those are two physical buttons as well

as the hazard light button and you've

got the volume knob with a play pause

button in the middle of it now the nice

thing about the play pause button and

you might not know this is that when

you're on a phone call but you're not on

the phone screen in the touch screen you

can actually hang up on a call with the

play pause button just another nice

little detail one very cool feature that

i really like about the Polestar seats

not only are they electric on both sides

and very adjustable in terms of height

and adjustment and everything that's

normal in lumbar as well

you've got the ability to extend the

base of the seat like in some of the

european cars that are out there now all

you have to do is grab the handle that's

underneath the front and you can fully

extend or fully retract it to allow for

better thigh support you can adjust the

steering wheel it's both telescopic and

adjustable in height and you can pull it

out actually quite far so i'm sure most

people will be able to find a

comfortable driving position

something that i really like in the

Polestar 2 is the fact that the people

at Polestar when they were designing

the window buttons did the smart thing

that i think should also be standard

across the industry is the fact that the

buttons are all auto up and auto down

that is not just the front windows but

the front and the rear

the Polestar 2 also has front and rear

heated seats now this particular model

doesn't have the leather seats and i'll

get into the specs and details after

this segment just before i take this car

for a drive to let you know what's

available and what things are going to

cost you now when it comes time to drive

away like i mentioned earlier in the

video all you have to do is get in the

car as long as you've got the key fob in

your pocket press on the brake pedal

pull down on the lever

and the car is ready to go

if you want to put the car in park you

just press the p button right here

and the car is in park the brakes get

applied and you're ready to get out so

what about this android automotive and

the great touchscreen in the middle of

this dash this is the main screen of

android automotive now it is a press car

and it's got a profile that was already

there and i've got whatever apps were

installed by whoever had this car before

each section of this main screen is

customizable at a certain level if you

wanted to change anything that's in here

or move apps around you tap on this icon

at the top

and then you can basically press hold

and drag to the section that you want to

move the app to it once that's done you

go back to the main home screen by

tapping on the home button which is the

little bar at the bottom of the screen

and then you've got other apps that are

available simply by swiping down like i

just did same thing for the radio

section if you wanted to play youtube

music or something else you can swipe

down and get those apps and then swipe

back up to get back to the main app that

was running last

another little detail is that polestar

has included a little cleaning cloth and

this little packet can be found in the

center console

and you can use it to clean the touch

screen because obviously it's a

fingerprint magnet now with the door

open and me sitting in the car the

touchscreen becomes active fortunately

polestar has thought of that and you can

lock the touchscreen by pressing and

holding the home button on the bottom of

the screen for two seconds

and it becomes locked so you can clean

the screen once you're done just press

and hold the home button again and it

unlocks the screen making it functional

again

as i mentioned there may be some things

that are less intuitive to some users

like i experienced with the right side

of the steering wheel fortunately

polestar has come up with a solution for

that and it's directly in the center

touch screen

all you have to do is tap on the icon

here with the grid and then select the

user manual icon here at the bottom

once you're there then you can select

the interior

and in this particular case i want to

find the right steering button

information so i tap on that

it shows me the base information and i

can slide a little bit to the right for

other stuff

but i can click on read more

and it tells me exactly what everything

is for

there's also a related information

section at the bottom

now i've closed the driver's side door

and i've got the seat belt on because

i've put the car in drive because i want

to show you one of the features that i

thought was really cool in this car and

that is this icon on the top left here

which is the reverse camera which is

actually a 360 degree view camera it

uses all of the cameras around the car

to create an overhead view and shows you

things that are close to the car and

beeps as well because it's got all of

the parking sensors all around it if

you're interested in getting much more

detailed information on the menus of the

Polestar 2 and android automotive then

please click on that subscribe button

because i'm making a video about the

Polestar 2's android automotive menus now

it's a long segment so i couldn't

include it in this video but if you're

subscribed and have the notification

bell checked off then you'll be notified

when i release it you may also be

interested in knowing that i have social

media links and i'll put them up here on

the screen and in the description below

got an instagram account with all sorts

of eevee and non-eevee related things

i've got a facebook page where you can

read news and ask me questions i've got

a website that sort of catches

everything and i've also got a kofi

account so if you feel like buying me a

coffee on kofi i would greatly

appreciate it so don't forget be sure to

be subscribed to my channel if you don't

want to miss my future videos because i

have absolutely no posting schedule

if you're sitting in the back of the

Polestar 2 and you're not six foot five

you're not going to have a problem now

this front seat is positioned for me as

a driver at five feet eight inches tall

and i'll put that in meters up here

somewhere because i never remember what

my height is in meters and the seating

position for the person in the back is

actually quite comfortable now i have

some decent thigh support here because

the floor of the Polestar 2 is actually

quite low allowing for my feet to get

underneath the front seat and be pushed

forward a little bit now i do encounter

something under the seat that prevents

me from putting them any further forward

but this is still pretty comfortable and

i think on a longer road trip i would be

okay now the center console is on a hump

in the middle of the polestar too much

like with a traditional gas powered car

they've got a hump and i'm guessing

they've got batteries under there or

something else so that means that if

you're sitting in the middle you're not

going to be in the best position

now that means to me this is more of a

four passenger car than a five passenger

car but if you're stuck and you put

somebody in the middle you'll be able to

get by another feature in the back here

is an armrest that you can pull down

which is where the skis can be passed

through with the ski opening in the back

seats

you've got two power ports these are

usbc hidden under this little cover here

as well as the buttons for the rear seat

heaters you've also got the rear air and

heating controls that allow you to turn

the vents on and off by turning the dial

on the vent as well as changing the

direction left and right or up and down

a couple other interesting things that i

found in the back here are the hooks

that they've got here where you can hook

a bag or i guess a jacket or a shirt if

you really have to and then you've got

the lights that are back here these are

touch sensitive lights essentially when

you tap on it it will turn on and then

turn off again there's also a little

light that's beside it so when you're

driving at night it's a mood light it

also offers hard plastic backs on the

front seats as well as some nets to be

able to store some things in them now

it's nice because they have this on both

the driver and the passenger seat

and then i've saved the best for last

that's this panoramic sunroof now much

like in my ionic 5 preview video that i

released recently

this car has a full glass roof which is

amazing and like i said in that last

video i wish that my car had this and

that i wish the kia ev6 had it as well

because in my opinion

this is just beautiful and gives you

such an open airy feeling in the car

but the big question is what does it

cost now polestar has kept things

relatively simple offering two variants

three option packs and three features

that can be added now i'm not a big

specs guy so i'm not going to put a ton

of things up here on the screen but i

will put the basics and the most

important things the two-wheel drive

variant being a front-wheel drive which

is a little bit of a surprise has a 427

kilometer range with a 78 kilowatt hour

battery it offers 228 horsepower and 243

pound foot of torque now that particular

model will cost you 49 900 canadian this

means that it's excluded from the

federal five thousand dollar federal

rebate but it is applicable for the

eight thousand dollar quebec provincial

rebate

now the all-wheel drive model that's

what i've got here is far more powerful

it only loses 27 kilometers of range

it's rated at 400 kilometers of range

but it will cost you 56

900

what does that extra seven thousand

dollars get you well it gets you an

all-wheel drive package that gives you

402 horsepower and 487 pound-feet of

torque that being priced at 56 900

canadian dollars means it is excluded

from the canadian five thousand dollar

federal rebate but being under sixty

thousand dollars it is applicable for

the eight thousand dollar quebec

provincial rebate now the three options

that you can change or add are the paint

color the extra paint color is going to

cost you 1400 canadian dollars you can

also change the wheels for an extra 1400

these are 19 inch you can go to a 20

inch and then there's the ventilated

napa leather with reconstructed wood

deco now the napa leather will give you

the optional ventilated seats which you

don't get in this material seat that's

in this particular model here now that

extra leather and deco and ventilated

seats is going to cost you an extra 5000

canadian dollars as mentioned there are

three feature packs these three feature

packs are the plus pack the pilot pack

and the performance pack now the

performance pack is fairly

self-explanatory and is going to run you

an extra six thousand five hundred

dollars canadian and what it gives you

is some 20-inch wheels with some very

sticky rubber you also get some ohlins

coil-over adjustable shocks you get

brembo gold four piston calipers at all

four wheels as well as some gold seat

belts now the middle pack that i talked

about was the pilot pack now the pilot

pack doesn't only add smart cruise

control or their driver assist it also

adds a bunch of safety features and i'll

have those listed up here so

it's kind of an option but you kind of

really want it for all the safety

features that are included in a lot of

other cars and the pilot pack is gonna

cost you an extra 4500 canadian dollars

now the last pack to consider is the

plus pack now being on the east coast

here in the province of quebec with cold

winters i think this one is not really

an option because it adds a heat pump

and it also adds heated steering wheel

heated washer nozzles and heated rear

seats now there are some other things

and i'll list them here but it's an

extra 5500 canadian dollars to get this

so to me that's not really an option in

the province of quebec you kind of need

it now with all that out of the way

let's see how this thing drives

so what's it really like to drive the

Polestar 2 well i can tell you that the

first time i got in this car and i

hammered it

oh my god

it goes from

nothing to illegal way too quickly

this is definitely

not my nero ev the power is instant and

it's very

very strong from the beginning with no

spin whatsoever

if you've been in a tesla model 3

performance all-wheel drive

then you'll know what i mean

now the one thing that i noticed well

there are a couple things that i noticed

the first thing that i noticed when i

sat in the car is the fact that the

seating position is definitely lower

than what i'm used to

the ride comfort is far more sporty this

is definitely not something that goes

over bumpy gravel roads very smoothly

as you can tell from this on-ramp

off-ramp the condition of our roads are

terrible

and there's quite a few potholes that

have been patched but even though it's

patched up

the car still transmits every single

bump into the cabin this ring does get a

little bit of the feel but it handles it

quite well

it's like being on a ride in an

amusement park it's not the best thing

in the world

this is the province of quebec in canada

not a third world country you'd think

you wouldn't have to do slalom around

potholes to avoid damaging your car but

that's the way it

that's the way it is here

now the ride comfort on the highway is

pretty good considering the suspension

is much more stiff than in my car when

the roads don't have tons of bumps in

them and in the province of quebec that

isn't very often the ride is excellent

and very smooth

but the handling is phenomenal

now

this car in a curve at speeds that i

would not do with my nero

is very impressive now even though this

is the all-wheel drive that does not

have the performance pack which means

the suspension the 20-inch wheels and

the brembo brakes

the car

turns

it's just it sticks it's really

impressive let's try this on-ramp

off-ramp situation right here this is a

25 kilometer per hour curve

50

55

and accelerate to 80.

it is

very very cool

and go

70. to over a hundred kilometers an hour

very impressive

now as for the adaptive cruise control

it actually does a pretty good job so

the pilot pack which adds all of the

smart safety features as well as the

adaptive cruise

is in this car and when i activate it

with the button on the left side of the

steering wheel

it basically will hold the car in its

lane and keep a distance with the

vehicles that are in front of it

now the one thing that i did notice is

that it's a little bit more aggressive

in how it handles the centering of the

car in the lane

and

it's it's a little bit different than

what i'm used to now let's set the

pilot assist

it's at 100 kilometers an hour if i

press the

up button it increases in increments of

five kilometers per hour and if i press

and hold it'll go in increments of one

kilometer per hour

now the one thing that i noticed while

using the pilot assist in the Polestar 2

is that

it's a little bit more aggressive in its

corrections than i'm used to now it does

a good job staying in the lane

as long as it's very straight but if i

let go of the steering wheel and there's

a pretty aggressive curve coming up

ahead

the car tends to take the outside of the

lane and then turn in

it still does well

it's just that it's not as smooth a

transition as i'm used to now that

indicator is telling me that i have to

keep my fingers on the wheel even though

my hands were right beside the steering

wheel

within about two millimeters

but it's warning me that i had nothing

in terms of pressure on the steering

wheel all i had to do was grab it and

tug it around a little bit

now if i were to let go and wait another

15 seconds the pilot assist would turn

off completely

and that means the car would decelerate

as well so it's important that you pay

attention and keep your hands on the

wheel at all times

another thing that i really like about

the Polestar 2 is the one pedal driving

now the one pedal driving in this car is

currently set to standard and i've got

creep mode turned off in other words

when i get to a stop the car completely

stops and will not move forward like a

gas powered car does when you let off

the brake it is by far one of my

favorite features of an electric car i

wish my nero had it

something else that i noticed when i was

driving in this car was the fact that

the rear view is a little more

restrained than what i'm used to as well

now usually i've got a nice wide open

view in my car even though i've got

headrests in the back

now the two headrests that are back

there right now

they partially obscure the view it's not

really that that's the issue

it's the rear hatch being sloped like a

sedan

and the tail is a little higher so the

opening is kind of narrow in terms of

height it's still fine i can see very

well and it's not an issue

but it's definitely not as open as what

i'm used to it actually reminds me of

the tesla model why

one of the things that i really enjoy

about this car being android automotive

is the instrument cluster in front of me

now right now it's set to the normal

instrument cluster and i'll let you have

a look at that up close here on the

screen

and there's a button right here this

little toggle button if you can see it

on that other camera i hope you can

when you tap on it

it changes things over it switches the

interfaces that were there and moves

them over

to

put them on the small corners

and in the main section you've got

google maps that appears so you don't

have to have google maps on the center

screen you can have it in the middle

here

now driving on this highway with a very

nice road surface the car is nice and

quiet one of the things that i also

noticed was that the panoramic roof

doesn't make a lot of noise now when i

test drove the model y and made the

video about it it's one of the first

things that i noticed when i was driving

on the highway was the whistling or not

whistling but wind noise coming from the

leading edge of that glass panoramic

roof the Polestar 2 doesn't have that

problem

so what do i think of the Polestar 2 i

think it's a great electric car and not

only that i think it's a fantastic car

in general if you're looking at a tesla

model 3 or other cars in this size

category that are gas powered and in

this price range and i think you should

seriously consider the Polestar 2 because

it offers a ton of features a lot of

safety and some pretty excellent

handling even if you don't have the

performance pack now with that being

said as i mentioned earlier in this

video this is more of a four passenger

car than a five passenger car because of

the hump that's in the middle of the

rear seat i don't think it'd be very

convenient to have three adults in the

back so it's just something to consider

when you're shopping for a vehicle in

this size category i'd like to start by

saying a big thank you to polestar

canada for trusting me with their really

nice car for the week it was a fantastic

experience and i hope that i can do it

with other manufacturers because it's a

lot of fun although it was a little

daunting this is the first time i have

to do this kind of review and making two

videos in one week is not the easiest

thing to do it's a heck of a learning

experience but none of this could have

been possible without your help i really

do appreciate you watching my channel it

means the world to me that i'm able to

do this and even though it's a hobby

it's something that i really enjoy and

want to do as long as i can so thank you

very much i really do appreciate it and

if you could consider please clicking on

that subscribe button it really would

help i would love to hit 10 000

subscribers before the 31st of october i

know that's a little ambitious but hey

if you don't set goals you'll never hit

them over the last year i've been

getting some requests for t-shirts from

some of my viewers now if this is

something that you'd be interested in

terms of purchasing a t-shirt from me

then please put a comment in the comment

comments or suggestions for future

videos please put them in the comments

section below and as always thank you

very much i really appreciate you taking

the time to watch my video

this is my channel about electric cars

from the perspective of a first time ev

owner

this is the pulse

doug demiro again

now i think this gives it a distinct

advantage over the tesla model 3 which

does not have a hatchback of her

photographer

when it comes to opening the trunk on

the pull star there isn't a button on

the hatch it's got two ways of opening

the rear trunk the rear trunk well

actually there is a front trunk so

that wasn't totally incorrect

if you've been following my channel for

the last couple of years then you'll

know that most of the review

if you've been following my channel for

the last couple of years then you'll

know that most of my review videos of

electric cars

now there are kids running by and

i need to start over

then you'll know that my ev review

videos are directly compared

son of a schlitz

if you've been following my channel

i'm distracted by a cat i'm distracted

by the kids playing with the dog i'm

distracted by the noise

yay

as well as the measurement from here to

the floor of the car so that you get a

better idea of what

and now another car goes by on a street

that goes nowhere and i have to start

over for the 4 billionth time

yay and a couple design things that i

thought were pretty interesting now the

Polestar 2 doesn't have a

blue jays

whole family of blue jays

it just makes sense there's no real

reason to have to press a button to

start your electric car

of course there's a plane

if there wasn't a plane in one of my

videos

it wouldn't be one of my videos would it

you might also be interested in knowing

that i have social media links i've got

an android and android auto

yeah

and i've got a kofi account if you feel

like supporting me and by buying me a

coffee on kofi then it would

well plus pack and i think that the plus

pack is going to be very important here

in the province of quebec and of course

there's a plane

[Music]

now the plus pack offers you the heat

pump the heated rear seats heated

steering water water

that's because it's got the heated

washer fluid nozzles and steering wheel
