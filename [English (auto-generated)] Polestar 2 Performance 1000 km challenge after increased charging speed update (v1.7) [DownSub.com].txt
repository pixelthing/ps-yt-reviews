this video was brought to you by

stonebag about the rear planner mr green

ken power and marcus bill

yo what's up we're now at circle k our

usual starting point and behind me is

here you see

Polestar 2 pp

this one

actually i'm not sure if this one has a

heat pump but okay it doesn't matter too

much this one has the latest software so

it charges faster than before and we're

going to do one thousand kilometer

challenge true sweden swedish car via

sweden that's the way we roll just need

meat swedish meatballs

but we're getting ready now

we start in the evening look at this

this is the first time i try a white

Polestar

and you can see it's pp because it has

big fat brembo breaks

man i like it i like the looks of this

let's see how long it stays clean

but okay anyway

let me show you guys what we're doing we

are topping up 200 it's supposed to

finish in five minutes

we're getting oh we're getting a 10

kilowatt at 99 that's good

so the plan is to drive the swedish

route i have plotted in now hobby uh i

will see if i can reach speculative spec

respectively expected

and then we have to drive through the

night because we are doing this on the

weekday and i want to avoid the yotoborg

style so we will start exactly at nine

we've been driving for uh a little bit

now and uh here is uh sweeneson

swinson parkin it's supposed to be 114

kilometers roughly at the bridge there

look it's 100 and

ah

can you see the numbers

here they're

111 only

let's say 111.5 yeah 111.5

versus 114. i need to calculate no no

yeah

111.5

that is massive under report

all right all right okay let's get over

to sweden

all right we're getting close to um

speculate now and um

yeah right now the car estimates we will

arrive at eight percent

and if you look here this is interesting

i have a quite significant power limit

i'm down to around fifty percent power

only

at ten percent huh

i didn't have this with the sm well sm

is a single motor but that one had a

slightly smaller battery and less power

so i think even now with this power

i still have around 200 horsepower left

so it's probably still safe but it just

looks a little bit scary

immediately when i look at like this

well yeah i

we can probably make it there no problem

yeah two specular speculates back in

this packet expected

we are now at speculood we came here

with

eight percent left and turtle mode the

car had 25 power left it was starting to

go sluggish but let's see now it's

supposed to give me 150 kilowatt oh look

at that

oh yeah e-tron go home look at that

speed oh

you see the new update

from the pp or i mean the polestar

now it will pre-heat the battery before

arrival

and it also charges faster before last

time i tested the big battery

it only peaked at 133 kilowatt look at

this huh

like a bounce

okay i want to show you guys the car

white

white one Polestar

with a performance pack

huh

do you like that [ __ ]

do you like that [ __ ]

i think it's beautiful not gonna lie

it's a beautiful car

a little bit thirsty maybe

but good looking

this is the first time i tried the white

polestar

okay let me show you guys i think that

the screen tends to go black

you see

live stream people are like oh i want to

see

oh okay

legacy automakers

when you're connected to high power

charger

and you charge the battery up and you

reach a certain threshold it will ask

you

if you want to charge you want to find a

place to charge nine i don't want to

find a charging station

oh look at that oh yeah but let me show

you the

consumption 287 but remember that we

have two percent over reporting so

it's actually around 280 watt amp

kilometer but we had tailwind and we had

that high consumption but okay i'm not

staying here too long i have to hurry

because the car charges so fast i'm now

going to vibe by

oh okay it's fairly snappy i like it

oh yeah okay this is one of the snappier

maps i've seen look at that look at that

huh like a boss

now we're going to iont they're very

important to navigate to the ionity

start

they have also live status

see here

yeah it shows you then four stalls all

of them are available

noise

all right

so

rule number one when you are charging

never stay in this charger screen you

can accidentally bump into the charger

level max level or you can press the

unlock cable here so just leave the

charge screen

wow it's still taking 100

okay okay anyway okay okay

restaurant break and then we had to get

ready

i went to the restroom and yeah

15-minute charting top we are good to go

to while back

look at that speed

this is so much faster than sm battery

[Music]

we are now at ionity valve i look like

the hulk

it's always fun to do this okay anyway

here it says that

it's prohibited to idle

uh to smoke

tobacco

and to use open fire

well well well okay i'll try not to use

open fire and to idle too much so you

see this is super consistent

every time we arrive we get 150 kilowatt

actually it pulls a little bit more

because we're pulling extra power for

the heater this is great but look at

these numbers

you know we are trying faster and fat

eatron we're getting

fat each one i don't remember i think

fat itching doesn't have this voltage

and fat iron is limited to around 360

amp if i remember correctly so fat etron

at low state of charge would be hovering

around 135 kilowatt and then it was

build up the speed as the voltage goes

up

huh isn't that great huh

so yeah i'm just admiring the the cool

car here

but okay i have to go to the restroom

and then we are heading for

helsingborg

so alberto plan estimates that we need

54

in order to reach helsingborg

this car now doesn't tell me yet it's

say i will ride with zero percent

uh so 54 okay i should get maybe 65 then

and right now we are at 51 percent

but it is so fast we've been charging

now for 17 minutes we went from eight

percent knowing nine percent to 51 and

what the each charting stop is around uh

25 minutes only so this car charges way

faster than the sm

so that means that

again i brought some i bought some food

it's like okay i don't have time for the

hot tub

so this one i can eat while driving

we'll see i guess i'll start eating it

now and

yeah wait for this yeah

but i have to say that

i pointed out this before i feel like

the interior in the Polestar is a bit

cramped yesterday and today i tested the

model 3

and i feel like the model 3 has way more

space than the Polestar poles are

filled with cramped

we are on the move again that charging

stop was almost half an hour long we

charged with 70

and

yeah

i hope we have enough we should have

enough but

right now just showing you that the car

estimates we will arrive at 16

it will probably drop by the time we

arrive we will see i guess

but

right now we have wet roads

hopefully it dries out soon

and this is 120 song the high speed

stretch

so

[Music]

we are now in helsingborg and wow we

have we have traveled around five hours

but we are slightly past halfway mark

now this is just remarkable how fast the

the Polestar is now compared to before

but remember that the average speed here

is going to drop because we have that

initial uh 250 kilometer before we had

to start uh charging the first time but

i think we're looking forward for a

really good time it's going to be a big

improvement over the last one but the

deduction time now is three minutes so

far we had two minutes of uh

um

the the road construction you guys saw

it on the way down here as always it's

been there for a long time but also i

made a small mistake

so

i started charging and then after one

minute it stopped and i was like huh

what's wrong but then i started charging

it so i lost a little bit of time i lost

about a minute because i had to start

charging but the problem was that

i was

here and you see i complained about this

before

the unlock cable here is so big it takes

up the whole bottom here and this cable

i'm going to be careful now

this cable

touched that

part and then it stopped charging and

there's no confirmation

about stopping the charging it would

just stop charging

so it was my mistake because normally

normal people they don't have a live

stream phone

with some cables running hairs

yeah but okay as usual we are getting

massive speed yes each one go home

um you see this is the the downside of

coming here at night you see what's the

time now

yeah it's it's 2 30 at night

the problem is that this circle k

uh is closed for

people inside it's for safety

so they have not luca which is a night

i don't know what it's called but

there's a little opening you can just

like in germany you know

so that's the downside so that's why we

just have to wait around here pee in the

bush

and then wait until we have enough but

at least via bike is open and the gas

station about back

we've been charging now for about half

an hour and i just noticed something

on the previous run we charged to 70

and we

we were receiving 71 kilowatt

now we're getting 79 kilowatt

actually

it could seem like it takes a long time

like three charting stops before we get

the proper heat in the battery

okay but

this time i need 75

i think

because

we've been riding on the tailwind

on the way south but now we have to face

the headwind and we have pretty strong

wind going right here

where the 120 zone is

so even though the car claims 18 yeah i

forgot to mention yeah

uh the car will always claim this but

then once we get there

we will probably have ten percent less

so eight percent is usually what i try

to aim for because if i go down to two

percent

uh we might have some massive power

limit i mean i already saw the turtle

over here right before we entered here

[Music]

we are back at wild bike charging up

it's so quiet here at night

as usual

we get maximum speed 150

over 150 kilowatt until 28

now throttles this time i need around 45

to 50 only so i have to hurry um

i only have time to go and grab some

food

that i have to eat while driving

that's it

the car has been oh okay it's getting a

little bit dirty now but

so far so good let me see can i do this

and then close it no it won't okay the

screen is very off happy

but okay

quick pit stop here

oh look at that

i like the white color is this pearl

white

or is it just uh

oh it's i think it's pretty light yeah

it looks like pearl white

we are back on the road again that was

14 minute charting stop

to 50 percent

i have to eat

while driving that's the only way to do

it

good stuff man it's okay

two for forty

[Music]

second to last turning top

i start feeling the fatigue

so

yeah

charging here

and as always we start with 150

kilowatts and then they drop a little

bit i ate some food

uh just show

that typically uh

17 minutes we came here with 10 percent

so uh this time i think we need around

60k

60

we have to check inside now oh it's two

degrees over here

at helsingborg it was seven degrees or

eight degrees oh

big difference from

from north to south

but okay so right now the car

estimates that we will arrive at 11

right this is always confusing there is

one estimation here

and then if you go back

okay this time it's the same but many

times the estimation here

and the estimation here

does not correspond

okay but

it's a long stretch here

i think i want to go for 60 just to be

sure

[Music]

we are now in storm start final stop

charlie stop usually we stop here at

sturmsound

there is an eatron gt a swedish eatrim

gt congating right now i checked it out

it was starting at 70 kilowatts i've

been pumping in 150 kilowatt in the

beginning and now let me check

now i'm taking 108 kilowatt

this car charge is like a boss now so i

calculated that we need around

well i but the replant that says we need

48

just to get to

oslo but i need a little margin so let's

say 60

shouldn't take too long to get 60.

yeah i love this feature where you

pre-heat the car

while you're gone

the only problem is that

you have to uh

once you stop the car it's grayed out

and you have to get open door

before you can enable it it's kind of

weird but okay

so all right almost done now

uh let me see my only concern is that

there is some mornings down wait wait

let me see

so okay let me just search with here now

normally i just search for all no

no

it should show up here

close to my home whoa

if you click here

you see the overview

you see the traffic

i don't know if you can see it i might

have to change the exposure a bit here

but we have red traffic here is that

some kind of okay but we will do 999

here

and then we get stuck in traffic i guess

that almost doesn't matter right

yeah i think on hindsight i should have

started eight in the evening

not nine in the evening

all right i'm learning as i go

we are now on the final run towards

norway or the norwegian border

so uh it's almost seven in the morning

and the traffic is picking up

my only concern is that um

once we arrive in norway

there might be plenty of left lane

huggers slowing us down we'll see i

guess

but um

yeah

so far so good right

i have to say though today tonight i

mean this this run here has been almost

it's been perfect yeah it's been perfect

no deduction no screw-ups a couple of

failed handshakes but

just lost the

minute or two only that's it

so perfect run so far

um

i think it was a bad idea to start nine

in the evening because the problem now

is that well is this

what you see right now

i have never seen so much traffic around

here before

normally i would travel back here in the

evening on a saturday or yeah so you

know i had two failed handshake uh

during the

yeah trip and i actually didn't count

them

even though i lost two three minutes on

the failed handshakes and i had to retry

because i had no traffic but now

you can say that

this traffic here makes up for the lack

of traffic i had during the trip

holy [ __ ] these guys drive slow and they

camp oh the norwegians they are known

for camping in the left lane

look at these guys

so

um

the total deduction time was five

minutes but i will count it as

seven minutes

yeah to make it fair so um

that's it seven minute deduction

um

this is a bit weird because we are

supposed to do another nine right around

here this is tuesday three we took

regular charting stops we didn't go too

far we didn't go too short

we pretty much follow what we usually do

with other cars and you guys have seen

it

we're supposed to count down here

so

i'm not sure what i'm supposed to do now

um

yeah

okay let me see

whatever let's just make it here right

what is the time now we don't have a

countdown whatever the time is 7 49

which means

minus 10 minutes uh yeah we decided to

deduct 10 minutes total because of the

traffic it's been crazy the traffic

today

um which means that we have

10 hours and 40 minutes

that's it

10 hours and 40 minutes

and here is the consumption and

everything you see this is the confusing

part i thought we were supposed to go to

980 kilometers but the error was way

higher

seems like we have more like 2.6

yeah 2.6 error roughly or 2.5 percent

error

all right okay 307 then

well

you guys usually don't see this but

every time i do 99 or i finish the

1000km challenge i have to drive a small

stretch back to oslo and then i do the

the the wrap up and then you look at the

table well

the timing is kind of bad today because

there is style this happens every

morning it's just that normally i don't

see it

and it was so bad and i had to go to the

restroom so i i decided to come over

here to sheldon morton street and

what what so

what did i see suddenly at shell

martin's route

kim power

huh

kim power huh

they used to have shitty 50 kilowatt

fast charger here suddenly they have

chem power

all over the place now unfortunately

these chem power chargers are not

operational yet this guy's struggling

that guy is struggling i also tried mine

here it just says yeah this is not the

normal uh starting screen

so it's just power on self test

so we cannot get at the juice from here

but

i guess fortunately for me no big deal

because i have 16 left

at low range okay but i'm surprised even

with 16

you are still allowed to start

preheating

so yeah i can get home no problem uh

but i figured that instead of getting

stuck in the style over there we could

just do the wrap-up over here how about

that and then actually i need to eat so

i can just eat also before i leave

anyway let's do the wrap-up so i guess i

will show you guys a table and you can

see for yourself

um

now i need to comment that

what what the heck happened with the

previous poll star 2 performance yeah

that's a ppa event it was done in summer

in norway and then why did it take 11

and a half hours and why did it take

10 hours and 40 minutes this time what

was the

was the norway route really that slow

well i i'm not sure that's the thing i

don't know i what i know is that the

norway route has lower average speed

yeah i'm not gonna lie but the norway

route

also has way better charting network

like you saw today we have to drive

107 kilometers

and then 150 kilometers we don't have

optimal charging stops here whereas the

norway route has optimal charging stops

you can charge

you can really nail it there and not

only you remember what we did in norway

route eventually we would drive back and

forth we could drive it down to five

percent but today we couldn't i arrived

at 15 and nine percent

so in a way i still think that the

norway was fair

but the norway route

when we tested it back in norway we had

um we didn't have this update this

update is what i believe was really big

because it preheats before fast charging

so every time we arrive we will get 150

kilowatt consistent just like a tesla

just like a tie can you know it wouldn't

colgate anymore that's big and also the

fact that we get 150 kilowatt and it it

has this nice and flat 150 and then 140

and then

that is just amazing that's uh yeah

because you saw that the consumption was

quite high but because it was charging

fast pretty much like an e-tron almost

then it managed to set a pretty good

time so i believe that if we tried this

in summer and if we didn't use the pp we

use the one because it's on 20 inch

wheels

i believe we can get the time down to

around 10 20 something which is right on

par with the id 3 id4 and enyak and

those cars so it should make sense

because

the Polestar head charges faster than

the id3 or the mab cars but it seems to

be slightly thirstier than the mab car

so it makes sense but then versus the

single motor with a smaller battery that

one is more efficient i'm not sure why

if it's because of the weight or because

of the motor

i don't know but

that one is actually um where was it it

was

11 15

so that means

35 minutes slower

so is it worth it i think actually for

many people they will be happy with the

single motor with a smaller battery

because it costs a lot less and of

course if you can't wait then

go for this one and then it's also

faster more fun to drive this thing here

is so fast when i when i just floor it

from 60 to 120 kilometers per hour it

goes like a rocket

well anyway i think that's going to be

it for now i hope you guys enjoyed this

video as always thank you for watching

and talk to you later
