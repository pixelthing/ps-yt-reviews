in the race for electric vehicle

supremacy there have been two mortal

enemies startups and legacy auto on one

side the agile evie only companies and

startups with fresh ideas and the

ability to react quickly to the changing

landscape their leaders are

inspirational their aspirations

honorable

and their products so cutting edge that

you might get cut

on the other side legacy auto chasing

the startups with a mixture of fear and

incredulity they too seek to lead the

electric vehicle world sometimes making

grand statements that only highlight

just how out of touch they are

what they lack in agile development and

ev smarts though they make up for in

financial backing part sourcing and

massive dealer networks

their vehicles are often the smarter

choice for first-time owners they offer

competency reliability and the backing

of years of brand recognition but both

approaches have their benefits and both

their failings so what would happen if

an established legacy automaker set its

performance division free to become its

own entity rebranded it as an electric

vehicle company and then let it behave

like a startup instead of the legacy

auto it started as what if that brand

was headquartered in sweden home to

sensible furniture sensible food and

sensible cars but made in the modern

tech manufacturing capital of the world

china

and what if it was jointly owned between

a brand once known for taking its time

to get things right and one of the

world's largest automakers

what if the Polestar 2

is the answer

this is the 2022 Polestar 2 built on

volvo's compact modular architecture

platform a platform it shares the volvo

xc40 volvo c40 and lincoln co01 among

others there's a fair bit of volvo about

this car but we're here to see if

polstar's unique position in the ev

marketplace a startup owned by

established automakers has enabled it to

capture the eevee startup vibe with less

of the risk thanks to polstar portland

we've got this car for a few days to put

it through its paces check out some of

its features and give you our first

drive verdict this is the long version

of this video so if you want the bite

size version follow the link below and

because we want this to be as easy as

possible for you to follow we've put in

chapter marks so you can watch the bits

you want to and skip the rest

behind the wheel you feel fairly well

cocooned in with the center console

coming up pretty high there's reclaimed

wood inserts all throughout the dash

it's an optional extra which honestly

feels amazing to touch and the seats

come in a choice of materials including

cruelty free vegan leather or in this

case nappa leather the wheel is very

much a traditional volvo design with

some of the switch gear coming straight

from volvo's latest but again you get

the massive Polestar logo front and

center on the wheel and behind it this

fully glorious digital display that

really is crisp and easy to see

like many evs coming to market there's

no start button the seat switch knows

when someone is sitting in the driver's

seat and if there's a key present

it'll let you drive

phone as a key is on the way but it's a

little buggy right now but what's

interesting about the car is that the

center console here is running android

automotive no not android auto android

automotive it's like a little tablet

permanently glued to your car you can

sign in with a google account and it'll

pull everything in from your google

settings including your contacts and

your favorites your home address and

even your preferred music choice because

it's android automotive rather than

android auto you also get a data plan

with the car and you can download

various android automotive apps direct

to your vehicle

but there's no carplay integration for

apple users yet

which apparently

is coming

the bonus of android automotive though

speech recognition which frankly feels

like the best i've seen in a car you can

ask the car to turn on the heated seats

in the steering wheel set the navigation

or change the radio station all using

the voice button and google's voice api

meanwhile on the back there's again a

feeling of being cocooned not helped by

the massive tunnel down the center of

the car that's a throwback to the fact

the platform this car is built on is

both a gasoline and electric platform

but Polestar argues it lets it add extra

batteries down the center of the vehicle

lowering the rear foot well a little on

paper this is a five-seater but

seriously i'd not want to travel with

someone in between me and the other

outboard seat and if you've got a tall

driver be prepared to have your leg room

eaten up by the seat

still i do have my own ac vents back

here and the view for the roof is pretty

amazing however the problem i run into

is this

i can't sit with my head perfectly

straight because my temple brushes

against the back of the c-pillar here i

sort of have to keep my head cocked a

little bit to the side i'm about five

foot eight and i have plenty of headroom

this way

but this way

that's a weird place to not feel like i

have enough space one other thing i want

to mention the takeaway hook i guess

nikki would call it a curry hook up in

the front passenger it's hidden inside

the glove box and can flip out to hold

takeaway bag on the drive home so it

doesn't spill on the floor the glove box

also has another great feature worth

noting unlike most cars the manual is

just thrown in there there's a tiny

illuminated shelf for the main to sit on

that's cute but if you want the actual

latest manual it's available right there

in the touchscreen display

style wise this is a really well

proportioned car the wheels while 22 on

this model with manually adjustable

olene's dampers don't look massive and

while the cma platform on which this is

based on has plenty of crossovers built

upon it the polstar 2 most certainly is

not a crossover

there's a reasonably long bonnet and a

sweeping front screen that flows into

this panoramic glass roof while the rear

well it's got the sweeping rear of an

executive saloon of old but volvo

prefers to call it a fastback

which i guess i can see

unlike most electric cars today the

Polestar 2 has its charging door at the

rear of the vehicle where a petrol

filler cat would be and that's not a

surprise since this is built on a

platform that's intended for both petrol

and electric drivetrains let's look at

two more interesting features the first

is down here a sticker that details the

car's name its battery capacity and its

power this is a 78 kilowatt-hour battery

pack and it has 300 kilowatts funnily

enough i learned last night that Polestar

sends out updated badges to customers

when there's an over-the-air update that

unleashes extra performance or battery

capacity you just peel off the old

sticker and throw on the new one the

other one that is worth noting

are these mirrors unlike most cars where

the glass moves within the mirror

housing the rear view auto dimming

mirror is fixed and when you adjust the

mirror the whole housing moves too like

every volvo in the last few decades the

rear mirrors also tip down when

reversing so you can more easily see

behind you

like that

well the bottom of the glass here may

look like it's got a sedan truck waiting

to pop up you just do the pokey cokey

with your foot

and voila a fully accessible tailgate

there's 405 liters 14.3 cubic feet in

the rear or

1095 liters 38.6 cubic feet if you fold

down the 60 40 split seats there's also

some nice touches back here if you're

someone who wants to stop your stuff

from falling around the rear a cargo net

at the sides as well as a split load bay

for stuff that you have to keep upright

at all costs

at the front there's a front trunk but

there's no easy release mechanism here

you've got to pull the front release

cable by the driver's door pillar just

like you would a regular old hood pull

and then release the catch manually up

front

when you get that open you've got 35

liters

1.2 cubic feet of storage far less than

the tesla model 3 model y or the mustang

machi but it's large enough for a laptop

bag or small overnight case your

charging cables as the case may be and

whatever else you can fit and that's a

lot more than the bmw i3 or hyundai

ionic 5 key v6 can offer

and with this car

the

charging cables you get are a full 40

amp evse which as kwa and elliott

pointed out is a solid like 400

thing you would have to buy for yourself

if you don't already have one although i

mentioned to see just how many people

are buying the Polestar 2 when it's

actually their first ev and don't

already have something like this

at the front of the car you get probably

the biggest hint that the Polestar 2

has swedish blood pumping through its

veins

the thor's hammer headlights now well

known from volvo's cars but on the

Polestar 2 they've been streamlined a bit

and swooped back some and they give the

car a really distinctive and i think

actually really elegant subtly

aggressive look

you also have this pretty expansive

grille which is

i don't know how to feel about it

to me it really highlights that this is

a cross-platformed car this feels like

the grille of internal combustion car

with some cladding slapped over it but

at the same time

it doesn't look bad and it does serve a

purpose it helps bring in air for the

car's active cooling system

look above the grill and you've got the

Polestar logo something that you'll see

around the car more than an actual name

polestar but our favorite one is the

pulstar logo that's on the roof of the

car there's a little shelf inside the

car just behind the rear view mirror

that projects the Polestar logo onto the

glass roof at night talking of lights

i've got to tell you about the little

dance the Polestar's light suit at night

if you unlock the car with this

very boring looking key the lights do a

little dance front and rear and it is

legitimately really fun and makes me

smile which is good because the key

doesn't

finally got behind the wheel of a pulse

star too we did it it took a while

i mean to be fair polestar is a small

company

as we said in the introduction it kind

of works like a startup but it's owned

by

not one but two legacy automakers which

is kind of

interesting

and it went public through a spack

which is

my least favorite way of entering the

stock market yep but the result is a car

that

undeniably feels like a volvo

but a volvo that's maybe not quite as

boring

as a as a regular volvo might be and

that's not to say that volvos are boring

because i love volvos

i love the fact that we've got reclaimed

wood here and i know it's a you said it

was a 5 000 option something like that

this interior yeah

but it it has a level of premium about

it when we

we drove last night to go pick up a

takeout in it and my partner was

very complimentary about the car and

actually noticed that it was

it felt a little bit more premium in

some ways than say the ford mustang

marquee oh i totally agree with that i

think that the overall impact is very

premium dare i say

even kind of luxury especially with this

interior but then there are these there

are these touch points where i feel like

it falls down a little bit the controls

for the vents are very flimsy the key is

comically cheap and there's there are

places where there are seams on the

interior that i just don't think are as

as clean as i want and the the buttons

on the steering wheel i don't love the

feel of them but i'm i'm nitpicking what

is honestly a very very very nice

interior i would say probably

the nicest interior and ev that i've sat

in

other than porsche one thing i

absolutely love about this is this

digital display

isn't it amazing it is fantastic

far better dare i say it than tesla or

ford yeah i have to agree i mean i don't

haven't experienced the new tesla uh

front display

that is it's so crisp it's so clean it

conveys information really really well

and it's honestly quite beautiful and

the pinnacle is nice deep set

i really like all of the information

displays in this car the center tablet

is is good it's very responsive i think

its bezel is absurdly large we joke

about

the model 3 and the maki feeling you've

got an ipad glued to your dash this

really feels like you've got you know a

galaxy tablet or an ipad glue i'm glad

that you showed a galaxy tablet because

obviously it runs right android

automotive not android operating system

not android auto android automotive

which is basically a special

baked in

automotive version of the android os

it's very restrictive in what you can do

but apparently you can watch videos as a

video app that you can watch i did

download it the other night i cannot

tell you how little i care about that

you can watch that while you're charging

i can watch movies in my tesla you know

how often i have

like

once

as a joke and it took like forever to

load and stuff the newer teslas that

have newer the new ryzen chips are

faster about that but yeah i don't care

about that what i do care about is that

the integration of this android

automotive with the car

seems really good so like we're

navigating right now using google maps

and it's telling us what our estimated

state of charge will be at our

destination in a you know all that sort

of integration is really really nice and

it is

super responsive i

i'm developing less and less of a

tolerance for cars that are very touch

screen dependent and then have laggy

slow touch screens um and i i kind of

came into this expecting

not to be super super impressed by this

thing's touch screen and i actually

overall have have been really pleased

with the performance of the os because

of the customization of this car

you can actually change a whole lot

about it so you can change

the creep mode you can change the

regenerative braking and this is

something that i think is

going to really make it appeal

to first-time ev drivers

it is very tesla-like in that way i

think it's one thing that tesla has sort

of set the standard for is that driver

profiles should include how tight do you

want your steering wheel what sort of

regen do you want what sort of

acceleration do you want and you very

much have that in this car it's also

worth noting that when you one pedal

drive this car

you can come to a complete stop without

using the brake the brake lights go on

and the friction brakes are engaged it

is a it is a true hold mode you can one

pedal drive this and never use the brake

which i really like it is a little more

aggressive on liftoff than i sometimes

like it feels almost like an i3 in that

way if you like fully lift off the pedal

i would get used to it super fast i mean

i was getting used to it i actually

really

like the throttle mapping and everything

and the regen mapping on this car i

found this car very very pleasant

to sort of accelerate and brake with

we have 300 kilowatts at the wheels 78

kilowatt-hour battery pack

nought to

100 kilometers per hour which is 62

miles per hour

in about 4.7 seconds which puts it right

in the ballpark of uh cars like the

marquee

dual motor performance

or the premium as they call it

you know it doesn't feel that to me it

feels quicker

the way that this is set up

it allows you to drive very naturally

around town without fear

that looking at the throttle wrong

is going to somehow land you in

trouble yeah

this feels like the you know the bottom

half of the throttle

it's very well mapped

very gentle

very smooth

no jerkiness no jerkiness at all and

it's very smooth even better i think the

throttling response than it is on my

bolt and i like the throttle response of

my bolt what i feel like it emulates in

a lot of ways

is a turbocharged engine yes because i

can see that you

when you're keeping the throttle in like

the first half of the throttle uh travel

it's gentle i wouldn't say it's

underpowered at all but it's gentle it's

smooth it's easy and then once you pass

a certain point it's like the car says

okay now you want oomph i'm gonna give

it to you and it will throw you back

into your seat and it's very exciting

and it's very very fun which may make

sense with polestar's performance

heritage absolutely

this is not a tesla so it doesn't have

autopilot but it has something very

close functionally to autopilot so

you put

your cruise control on and then you turn

on your pilot assist here

it does some of the steering for you i

can lift my hands off the wheel for a

short period of time however it would

nag you if i did that long term

my foot is off the throttle and it is

just

keeping me in the lane it's keeping me

centered

we tried this earlier on going around

corners and i noticed that the system

does a pretty good job of going around

the corners for you there's nothing that

seems

particularly

terrifying about its cornering

and interestingly

the assistance system there was having

difficulty because he went over a

section of a bridge that didn't have

clear lane markings and the car was just

weaving and weaving and weaving and

weaving and weaving

that felt horrible

um i didn't get a ton of time with this

this didn't feel as secure to me in its

lane centering as i find with tesla

autopilot or ford blue cruise it's a

nice workload reducer and the adaptive

cruise control in this car i thought was

really quite good

so we're heading back we drove out to a

a mall about what 40 50 miles outside of

portland

we went there because it was about the

limit of the cars state of charge

and we've been told

that if you set a rapid charger as a

destination

what the car will then do

is it will

pre-heat the battery people had

complained to you that Polestar 2

doesn't charge very rapidly yeah i had i

had heard a number of people say that

like you know 60 70 kilowatts is what

they were getting out of the pulse star

too so i was really prepared to be

disappointed and

i was not we plugged in at around like

19 20 state of charge

and at the very start we were pulling

down 145 kilowatts at 150 kilowatt

station and then it it quickly dropped

off and settled to about like 135 and it

held 135 for a decent amount of time and

by the time you kate and i were back

from picking up food the car was already

at 75 state of charge like it charged up

awfully quickly and we actually charged

up to like 85 90 percent because we

hadn't finished eating right we sat nate

but and it did slow down of course but

even at like 80

percent 83 it was still pulling at 55

kilowatts and it didn't really you know

drop off really precipitously until sort

of not long before we unplugged um

that's the kind of charging performance

that i personally would want to see in a

car that i owned one thing that i've

noticed and you've commented on it too

is that this car doesn't have the best

visibility now at the front i've got to

say these a-pillars are actually quite

small

compared to a lot of electric cars that

i've driven yeah i'd agree that actually

the a-pillars are not bad um i think the

the roof line is a little bit low

the b pillars are pretty unpleasant the

c-pillars are brutal and the

rear window i believe i described it as

lamborghini like in terms of how much

actual like real estate you can see

there's very funny of course the sloped

window so it's a decent chunk of glass

but the actual like height of what you

see through is very small

and this isn't an eevee thing this is a

car thing if you are putting a giant

piece of glass over my head

i need a shade like yeah we're fine

right now but it's also 46 degrees in

january in oregon if i was in arizona in

august i think i might still want to

shade even though i understand the

window is tinted and it's got some you

know uv protection and the like i still

am going to want some sort of shade or

the you know

automatically the opacity thing that you

get in the porsche now there are a

couple of things that you really did

like about this car yeah i didn't even

think about it because

i don't own a tesla so the first one is

it actually has proper door handles on

the inside and the outside it has door

handles i like that this car has door

handles i like door handles i don't like

door poppers like you have on

the mock e and like you're gonna have on

the cyber truck i don't like the handles

which are surfo handles that just

actuate a servo the way you have in the

model 3

like

this car has door handles and i really

appreciate that

the other thing that i really like about

this car is the seats are really

comfortable the seats are fantastic

you've got heated and ventilated front

seats

the only thing i'll say about the seats

is that i like a relatively high driving

position and this seat doesn't go as

high as i want it to but they are

fantastically comfortable and the seat

heater could fry an egg at its maximum

as could this heated steering wheel the

heated steering wheel has three stages

of heat and i really like all three of

them the low is this really nice just

warm the medium is sort of a good on a

cold day and at maximum heat it'll

really warm up your hands if your hands

are cold i've really really liked that

so we like the feedback we like the

driving position of this car we like the

way that the car

just is easy to drive as a car we like

this bottle responsibly like the braking

action

we like the the heated seats and the

steering wheel because i mean it's a

swedish influence there i think we like

the chassis i mean we like the chassis

dynamics in this car i don't know how it

would compare to one without the Olin

dampers but like overall

yeah it's heavy and you really throw it

into a corner and it i don't feel like

it manages the weight as well as some

cars but it still manages it incredibly

well it's a very composed car but would

you buy it

that's a really good question i did not

expect when i got into this car that i

would even for a moment contemplate that

if if this car had 280 miles of range

and a lower price tag and a lower price

tag i would be very very very tempted

equipped as it is

with this

very nice high spec interior that this

one is optioned with

i would even be if

i had the budget i would even consider

this a really incredibly strong

contender at this price point personally

i think i would need more range out of

it than i that i'm getting and that

i hate that that i say that

might be i think my biggest takeaway

from this car

is that

if this is what Polestar can do with a

shared platform that crosses both ev

plug-in hybrid and petrol vehicles

i cannot wait

to see what Polestar can do

with a bespoke

ground up eevee

that's one of my my big takeaways my

other big takeaway is that this is the

first

chinese ev that i have driven

and if this is sort of uh

us indicator

of what chinese evs can be like

i'm really excited to see more of them

come to our shores

so there you have it the

2022 polstar 2. winter did you have fun

i had a lot of fun i liked this car

actually a lot more than i expected to

going in it's it's awfully cool and it

makes me very excited to see what comes

next
