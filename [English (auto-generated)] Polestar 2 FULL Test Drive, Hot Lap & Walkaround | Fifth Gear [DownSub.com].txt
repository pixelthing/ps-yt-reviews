hello i'm vicki butler henderson and

this is the fifth gear youtube channel

and this

is the Polestar 2 and i'm going to tell

you a few things that i like about it

but actually i'm going to start with

something that i don't like about it and

that is the key

now Polestar is the premium electric brand

from the company called Geely which owns

volvo and lotus so you'd think they'd

know a thing or two about design but

that is just a black

box anyway to the car it is a super

stylish saloon

or is it it is in fact a

hatchback it is a little bit wider a

little bit shorter and a bit heavier

than the tesla

model 3 it's arch rival but in here it

has got some really lovely design

features a little hideaway

cabin under there and then this pops up

for a small amount of shopping

all these bungees and nets great

and whilst we're back here i need to

show you something which i really do

love if you remember night rider the tv

show from the 80s then you are going to

fall in love with these lights

round here cunningly disguised as a fuel

filler cap

is the actual recharging point

and around the front because you don't

have an engine

you now have something called a frunk

a front trunk which is not very big

in this case just large enough to put

all

your wires while i am here i do need to

show you the grill which i

totally love it's so simple but

it does look like all these keys sort of

blocked together which is odd because i

really don't like the key but i love the

grill

and i also love these frameless

door mirrors i think they're exquisite a

real bit of beautiful design

inside welcome to a vegan interior

though you can get optional leather

seats if you fancy a bit of cow

now it is an exquisite place in here

really simple in its design but it is

oozing with touchy-feely materials like

this scandinavian wood

for your ears you have a harman kardon

stereo

and for your eyes you've got an 11 inch

touchscreen

which is built on google and if you're

an android and google fan

you are going to be in heaven with all

this tech

up here you have a full-length panoramic

roof

and keeping you nice and snug in the

seat

is this yellow seat belt it comes with

the optional extra performance pack

and i bought my first ever car an mg

metro because it had

red seat belts so i am a sucker for this

now remember that nasty key well you

don't really need it

because you can get into this car via an

app on your phone

but what is even more amazing is once

you

sit in the seat and close the door the

car is

ready to go you don't need to press any

buttons or do anything else

this car is based on the xc40

but it doesn't sound like an xc40

it sounds like this

nothing prices start at 49

900 pounds and it comes with a 78

kilowatt hour battery pack and

electric motors on the front and rear

axle

with a full battery you could do 292

miles between recharges and if you want

an 80 charge from zero that only takes

40 minutes it might be all electric and

it might be a new brand but it feels

like a traditional car you can feel the

weight of those batteries underneath you

sort of pulling you down onto the tarmac

but that gives it a nice

sturdy feel it feels light and

breezy in here although not as bright

and breezy as a tesla

model 3 which after testing on the main

show last year i was very

impressed with with approximately 50

miles more range than the equivalent

Polestar 2

and the network of charging stations on

paper it might seem

tesla has got the battle of the evs in

the bag

but polstar says it's planning a

two-wheel drive version bringing the

cost down to around

30 000 pounds making it a real rival

to all of tesla's model 3 offerings like

the tesla

the Polestar 2 also has a one pedal

regenerative braking feature which not

only helps to recharge the batteries

when you lift off the gas

but actively slows the car as well so

i'm going to see if i can do the next

few corners on one pedal alone

just lifting off the throttle letting

the car do the braking without me

actually putting my foot onto the brakes

so far so good

the interesting thing about the buying

process of a Polestar

is you can only buy them currently in

manchester or london

at places called Polestar spaces

you can have a test drive and they will

bring you one to your door

but there is no network as such it is a

an unusual way to sell a car if you do

decide to get your hands on one it's not

long before you realize just how fast

this car is

naught to 60 happens in 4.7 seconds

and it's got a top speed of 127 which

considering it's 2.1 tonnes of weight

is impressive as is the onboard tech

i can play with all sorts of things in

here the steering feel i can have light

standard or firm i can go into sport

mode i can go

into a low or a standard

one pedal drive mode it is a

sophisticated bit of kit

it feels like a very lovely tailored

suit that i am stepping into

the steering is accurate i do get some

decent feedback

and it is swift and composed

it's a very serene place to be

it's so quiet that it sort of makes you

just

stop and be a little bit more mindful

and never said that in a car before

overall

a very decent place to be right

let's go it has got a power output of

around

400 brake horsepower and that is split

50 50 between an electric motor at the

front and one at the back

and as well as the power being split

evenly

the weight distribution is also split 50

50 front and rear

making it a pretty good handling machine

it's eerily quiet i know that i'm going

quickly because my speedo says

currently i am doing 80 miles an hour

but i don't hear 80 miles an hour around

me

and i can't hear when i'm on the brakes

i can just feel it

so 65 miles an hour 70 miles an hour

through this mild right-hander 60 miles

an hour through the left then the right

back on the power the torque just

whizzing you into the future and the

brakes

hankering you back down 60 miles an hour

around this

right-hander here foot foot flat to the

floor what have we got before we have to

break

97 miles an hour then onto the brakes oh

could do with a little bit more feedback

from the brakes there under heavy heavy

stopping

at last we've got a noise it's the tyres

squealing

72 miles an hour

it's funny that you hear the tires

squealing more than anything else

there is a terrific amount of grip and a

terrific amount of

grunt 660 newton meters of torque

means that this car will hit 62 miles an

hour in 4.7

seconds the battery is good for 292

miles between

charges and from naught to 80 charge

only takes 40 minutes but if you drive

it like this constantly i don't think

you'd get many miles out of it

it is a very steady competent bit of kit

it lacks excitement and thrills but

it is a very decent car and a decent

place to be
