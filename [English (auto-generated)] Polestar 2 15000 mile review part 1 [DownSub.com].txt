good morning everyone and welcome to

this 15 000 mile Polestar review i've

had my Polestar for a year now and i

got it in uh it's just over here in fact

october last year and uh the

let's see we're looking at 14 788 miles

as i'm speaking so we're almost at 15

000 miles so i'm going to call it the 15

000 mile review

uh yeah so in this video i'm going to uh

i'm actually driving up to london today

so i'm going to combine this with a nice

range test the temperature is dropping

it's 8 degrees today and it'll just be

nice to see what kind of range

consumption figures i get because the

last time i did any kind of range

testing i think was probably in the

winter last year and it would be nice to

see if the software updates anything has

changed to see any kind of notable

difference so i'm going to combine the

range test with this 15 000 review and i

have a list of things that i'm going to

talk about so these include and i'm just

looking down at my list here so i don't

forget looks and styling of the car

performance the functionality of the

android tablet system over-the-air

updates space and practicality problems

with the car range and the customer

support and then a summary at the end it

might not be exactly in that order but

those are the things i'm going to cover

in this video so stick around and

hopefully this will be a really

informative and useful 15 000 mile

polstar 2 review

so let's have a look at the route we're

going to take today i will show you

google maps and let's see what kind of

estimates it's giving okay so i'm on the

maps page here and it's saying one hour

and 37 minutes that is a long time to

get to

well that's the problem with driving

into london 61 miles 57 on arrival so

let's hit start

and uh let's see what we're gonna get on

this display over here so move over here

and look you can see

yeah there's congestion we know that you

are on the fastest route you should

reach your destination by 1008. okay

thanks for the update google and there

we go you can see this limitation here

on the uh the region because of the 90

percent battery and possibly a

combination of temperature as well but

if we go on to this page here

interesting to see there 33.1 kilowatt

hours per 100 miles over the last 4 900

miles that's actually really good

consumption but a lot of that comes from

the tail end of the summer when the

weather was really good so what i'm

going to do is i'm going to reset that

i had that there for a long time and now

we got a fresh trip manual to have a

look at on this route today so let's

head off

[Music]

so the first thing i want to talk about

the Polestar that i think drew me to

the car initially are the looks and

styling of this car

before it was uh available in the uk

there'd been a lot of information on the

internet some ads on tv things like that

but what always drew

me to the car was was the looks the

design and the styling of this this car

it is unique there isn't really anything

else on the road i think that looks like

this car um all too often we find that i

think cars can be quite samey they look

quite similar in styling and design

but polstar have really come up with

something that looks quite different and

even though i've had this car for over a

year now and there are a lot more of

these on the road it still does seem to

um attract a lot of looks from from

people when you drive parts people that

will look at the car in car parks even

even people who will ask questions and

say what is that i haven't seen that

before that's an unusual looking car now

with an unusual looking car obviously

comes the downside that perhaps you

don't like the styling not everybody

does because

when you're kind of a bit bold and

ambitious

are always going to be people that do or

don't like the design approach that you

take

but um i definitely think that that

there are certain aspects about the pole

star that do look very good um these

these wing mirrors for example are are a

really nice piece of design that uh that

look fantastic the headlights look

really good the the lights the back i

think are particularly

uh cool in the way that they sort of

they light up and they open up when you

unlock the car and they close down when

you relock the car

uh there's there's no doubt that there's

lots of nice little touches that are

sort of very futuristic but some also

classic designs um but beyond just looks

and styling there are a few things that

i think are really really clever so the

the side doors

if you look at the doors on the car it's

a big sort of bulky beefy looking car

and

the side doors are actually really

cleverly shaped and designed that this

happened to me at home the other day one

of my my driveway gates blew open in the

wind and it knocked into the car and i

thought oh great that's going to have

left a dent

and when i got out the car i realized

that the way that the door is sloped and

curved actually means that the the gate

had not made contact with the side of

the door where you would see it if it

had made a dent but it made contact with

the bottom edge of the of of the vehicle

and just at the bottom of the door which

is actually plastic lined and it had

left no mark so not only is the styling

very well considered in terms of what it

looks like but they've also thought out

some of these styling designs and i very

much doubt that's an accident but i

thought that was great that you know if

if a door blows open or knocks into your

car then actually the first point of

contact it makes is not the top edge of

the door and leaves a big dent but it's

actually the bottom edge of the car and

that is very very cool

styling of the interior well i think i'm

going to talk a little bit later about

the interior because it overlaps into

various things including the android

tablet as well as storage and

practicality but the interior of the car

again it's a love or hate kind of

styling i think it looks absolutely

fantastic um i love the the lines the

shapes the materials that they've used

the way that it lights up inside the

only things that i would say that they

could have given us that might have made

things a little bit better than they

already are is the option to change the

color of the lights like

you're just left with one white option

and i get that that's that's paul star's

choice that that's the way they want the

car to look but uh on a the previous bmw

i had i actually had a choice of colors

and i thought that was quite nice it

wasn't a wide range of choice it was

just a sort of an orange or a white but

even in the Polestar that would be nice

and there's no reason i guess why they

couldn't have gone a step further and

offered the option to choose even more

range of of colors it might go against

the styling and design choice i i

totally understand that but what would

have been nice is a little bit more

control over things like that especially

as it all goes through this uh the

tablet system in the middle

but that actually is part of the design

and styling that i think is great i i

really like that the tablet system in

the middle and the gear selector console

bit that runs down the center of the car

now

this comes more into sort of storage and

practicality but there are a lot of

people who don't like that element of

the car because what it does is it

creates this sort of solid middle

section that you might knock your knee

into and i've seen that in some of the

other reviews where people have

complained about knocking their knee

into this now i would just simply say i

don't find that a problem at all what i

do is i just rest my knee on that i

don't bash my knee into the middle

because i don't tend to well i don't see

any reason why i would swing my knee

around while i'm driving i use it as a

nice comfortable rest for the left leg

that can lean up against this however if

you drive something like a like a tesla

model 3

or this isn't really a comparison the

kia soul

these are really nice electric cars they

have a lot more space in the center and

it can create this sense of spaciousness

within the car um that the polestar

doesn't have the Polestar has a more

sort of keep you enclosed and protected

and comfortable kind of feel to it which

is part of their design and styling

approach so it's again this is something

that you know if you test drive the car

you will experience and you'll see what

i'm talking about but it's something to

consider because it's not necessarily

for everybody i really like it but um i

can see why some people might not like

the the the design and styling that is

is created to sort of keep you you

enclosed in this little capsule inside

your car

[Music]

so next up on my list i want to talk

about performance handling and just the

general driving experience of the

Polestar 2.

this car you've got to remember if

you're watching this review is the

original model that was released in

2020 which was last year

i got this car in october so since then

in 2021 there are other models available

with different uh power configurations

and different uh

different options at the initial launch

of the car there was just one version

and it has this glass roof behind me um

and it also has uh it's about 400 404

horsepower something like that so if you

uh bear that in mind when you're

watching this video um it applies only

to this particular car when i talk about

performance that's quite relevant

because this is a powerful car 400

horsepower is that that is a lot i mean

before that i had i've had a couple of

cars that have been pretty decent i had

a bmw 3 3 0 d of 5 3 5 d

um

actually i think it was a 3 3 5 d but my

point there is they had around the 300

320 horsepower kind of range a lot of

torque

but of course it came from a twin turbo

diesel engine small turbo large turbo

and uh really good gearboxes they always

felt very powerful very strong cars that

were they rarely when you when you put

your foot down especially if you're at

30 miles an hour up to sort of 70 that

talk was was so useful but when you get

into a car like the Polestar

that's a distant memory those cars don't

matter as far as i'm concerned they

might because a lot of people love

driving them so please don't take

offense but what i'm trying to say here

is you get instantaneous torque and

power from a car like the pulse start

and there is a lot of it it's spread

across all four wheels so the stability

of the car when you put your foot down

is pretty phenomenal now um the

the tesla model 3 performance is

obviously more powerful um it's north of

60 times quicker i haven't had a chance

to drive that car i did have a tesla

model 3 long range for a weekend earlier

on i think it was yeah it was earlier on

in the year and that is a really really

powerful car with superb performance and

if if i'm honest you know that really

really does go and it's very very

aggressive

um but the Polestar is very similar in

terms of performance to that particular

car and

when you put your foot down at a set of

traffic lights if you're at the front

and you're in an area where you can

legally accelerate from zero to 70 miles

an hour if you put your foot down the

the torque and the power

throws you back into your seat and it is

it's quite a phenomenal experience it

feels a little bit more like being on a

roller coaster that doesn't notice at a

17 or 200 mile an hour start in a few

seconds because it there is no lag

there's no changing of gears you don't

hear anything either other than the the

the wine of the electric motors as they

spool up

in a diesel car or a petrol car that's

powerful you will feel and you will

anticipate those gear changes so you get

a more engaged kind of experience which

a lot of purist drivers will much prefer

over the Polestart but all of those

kinds of

the the noise that you hear the gear

changes that kind of thing it actually

almost takes away some of the shock of

the acceleration that you get in an

electric car because it just launches

itself and that that is something that i

just don't get bored of um i have have

kids and they absolutely love it i mean

i have to warn them if i'm going to do

it because

if they're if they're sort of playing

with toys or they're next to the side it

does it throws your neck back quite

aggressively and they much preferred if

i i've warned them that i'm going to use

the power um and put my foot down

now the way in which polestar have

designed the car i think

is the accelerator is very forgiving so

when you when you drive normally

you don't feel any kind of excessive

launch excessive sort of jerkiness of

the car it's very very smooth but that

power is all available to you but it's

sort of it's like they've allocated it

to the back end of the uh the

accelerator pedal so when you put your

foot down past the 50 mark then you

start to get into that area where it's

taking advantage of all that power in

the kia e soul it's a lot easier to find

yourself sort of jerking the the

accelerator pedal a little bit um

because what you end up

the the first set of 20 of the pedal is

actually quite a lot of power it's quite

responsive so if you you tap it gently

you sort of spring forwards

which can be a little bit uncomfortable

but the pulse start doesn't do that that

first 20 30 percent of the pedal is very

very smooth and very gentle makes a very

easy driving experience

[Music]

[Music]

so tied in with performance obviously is

the handling element of the car because

the two really do go hand in hand and

without

really good handling i think the

performance is wasted in any car and

that's one thing that actually bmws are

really good for is that the handling

characteristics are are great

the the polestar though i would say is

for me really really good i'm not

someone who drives the car like a race

car driver i don't go to track days or

anything like that so i'm driving the

car in a real world scenario and and a

lot of the driving i end up doing is on

a and b roads in the uk and some of

those are small country lanes where the

road can be quite twisty quite bendy and

you do get an opportunity to enjoy the

good quality handling of a car or in

fact experience how bad the handling is

of certain cars now i don't want this to

be a Polestar versus tesla kind of

review that's not really what i'm aiming

at but i'm trying to sort of draw some

comparisons between cars that i've

experienced to give you an idea of what

the pulse does like so you have

limited control over your performance

and your handling within the main drive

page on the screen you can see here

you have the opportunity to change the

steering feel from light to standard to

firm now i don't really find that that

makes much of a difference for me i

prefer to just drive on standard firm i

thought was a little firm light was a

little too light so i just leave it on

standard um and then down at the bottom

you've got your creep on and off and

that affects your start and stop i leave

it off so i like the car to come to a

halt and just stop rather than sort of

creep forwards like like you might do um

in in a car

i guess a petrol car if you took your

foot or a diesel car if you put your

took your foot off the the brake pedal

could creep forward um and then you've

got the one pedal driving all flow and

standard that

that sort of links in a little bit more

to regenerative braking and energy

consumption but it also affects the

driving feel of the car now i like to

set mine on low so it means that as soon

as i take my foot off the accelerator

the car does start to slow down but it

does so fairly gently without being too

aggressive to the passengers or too

harsh if you set it to a one pedal

driving standard that um

that's much more aggressive in terms of

the way it slows down so you have to

ease your foot off the accelerator

rather than you can't just really take

your foot off the coast because the

coasting is quite harsh and i think uh

passengers in the car find that a little

bit uncomfortable but it's all down to

your own personal driving style but

that's all you can control in the car

there are no fancy options of of

controlling you know well i say fancy

but like even a lot of more affordable

cars have it but you can't really

control there's no eco mode there's no

way of like reducing or limiting your

performance and actually i really like

that because polestar just thought you

know what we want this to be a driving

car for people to enjoy and drive if we

start putting eco in eco plus mode

people will start driving like that and

then it takes away the enjoyment of the

car you can choose to drive

as

economically as you like 50 miles an

hour on a motorway if you want but

the car itself doesn't have the features

and options to do that and sometimes a

less is more approach is really really

good because that's what you get with a

Polestar now in terms of handling i

think the handling is really really good

the tesla model 3 does not handle

anywhere near as well as the polestar

and that i think i'd be really surprised

i mean obviously you can leave comments

down below feel free but i would be a

little surprised if anyone who has

driven both for at least a couple of

days would find that the tesla model 3

long range handles better the

performance may be that's a different

story

what i mean by this is i think that the

Polestar has the right balance between

comfort and stability on the road it is

very very stable with a low center of

gravity it's quite a heavy car

but but you feel engaged and linked in

with the steering wheel and and the the

way that the car is handling on the road

at all times there isn't as much

feedback as you get on a bmw where you

can really feel the road through the

steering wheel in the pole style when

you hit a bump sometimes you don't even

notice it in the steering wheel you feel

it in the body of the car but you don't

feel it through the steering wheel and

for some people that might not be great

but for me it doesn't really matter too

much it makes for a comfortable way to

drive

but the tesla i found um

although the the handling perhaps the

feel of the road through the steering

wheel is absolutely fine

the balance between the

firmness on the road and the way that

which the car handles wasn't as good as

it is on the Polestar and that

that's just my opinion but i think most

people would agree if you've driven the

two the pulse i have got that balance

just right and i think that makes for a

very enjoyable driving experience when

you're on the motorway when you're on a

roads b roads country lanes because the

car has been configured really well to

deal with both styles of driving and all

kinds of different road surfaces

now tied in with the handling on the

road is the wind noise

now tesla again i'm using the same

comparison have made lots of changes to

the cars over time so it's not really

always fair to make these types of

comparisons but the interior noise in

the Polestar 2 is very well controlled

the noise from the road is

it it's really really quiet that's all i

can say and the wind noise is well

controlled too so if you have any

concerns over noise the Polestar 2 that

that is not one to be concerned about

when i did the comparison between the

pulse on the tesla the tesla was noisier

i used a decibel meter and it didn't

come out as quiet or as comfortable

inside the car in my personal opinion

so yeah i mean just to summarize the

performance of the Polestar 2 is

exceptional it it's not the quickest

electric car 0-60 you can definitely get

a lot quicker and that is another area

where tesla have done very well but the

Polestars

combination of

excellent handling comfort on the road

and really really good performance and

the way in which it's it's set up

through the pedal i think is is superb

and i thoroughly enjoyed driving the car

partly for that reason over the last 15

000 miles

[Music]

[Music]

in this section i want to talk a bit

about the storage and practicality in

the Polestar 2 one of the uh again another

feature that really attracted me to this

car was that it's a it's a hatchback

style car so the boots opening

looked like it would be really good and

really spacious i didn't see the car

before i ordered one on the lease so

that was a bit of a risky move um but i

kind of took a leap of faith and thought

yeah this is going to be big enough with

enough space in it

and that is one of the key things that

that i thought was great about the pole

star is the way that the boot opens so

you can open up the boot you can take

the parcel shelf out you can fold down

the seats like you can see in all of

these shots and it's a really spacious

car very easy to transport things in and

uh big enough for a family of four to go

on holiday um

the boot

opening is really big and spacious

there's plenty of room in the boot

itself and then there's also a floor

that you can lift up and then there's

other a little bit of space underneath

in addition to the boot you've got the

uh

the front section the fruit or frunk or

whatever people like to call it

that has a little bit of storage space

but there's not much you can fit in

there i mean i use that for cable

storage i think that's what most people

do you can fit a it stays nice and cool

so you can put some drinks in there or

some food maybe even a small backpack

but it is a nice little extra bit of

storage space

now the only thing that i would say that

perhaps

isn't the best thing about the car is

that when i saw pictures of it it looked

really big and the car does

feel like a big car it's not excessively

big for uk uk roads or uk parking spaces

but um i'd say from the outside the car

looks bigger than perhaps it is on the

inside the boot is definitely big enough

it fits all the kind of stuff that we'd

need for a holiday we took the car up to

the lake district

and back from sussex which was over a

thousand miles of driving and that was

for just over a week and we were easily

able to fit everything that we needed

into the car no no problems at all when

i tried to load my sort of usual holiday

stuff into the tesla model 3 it was a

little bit more of a challenge because

it is a saloon style car with a boot

opening that isn't quite as tall so when

you're trying to stack things in

then you you might not be able to fit

them in however the tesla model 3's boot

actually feels massive it feels really

spacious so if you have the right

combination of things

you might actually prefer that style of

boot so i would say yeah the Polestars

boot space and general in interior

storage is absolutely fine it's not a

massive car though that's something you

need to bear in mind if you're buying

this for a family of four then you're

probably going to be absolutely fine

fitting what you need into the car but

if you've got a family of five

and you want to have three children on

the backseat that is going to be more

difficult because you've got this bump

in the middle which you don't have in a

lot of other electric cars the

mitsubishi outlander phev the tesla

model 3 the kia e soul they all are flat

across the back now

yeah this it is partly because the pulse

star platform

that it's designed on

that's that's the reason why that bump

is there and i'm sure they put it to

good use i imagine there might be some

battery storage or something like that i

don't know but it's kind of annoying

because

you if you're sitting a person in the

middle there they've got to sit with

their their feet on either side of this

bump which makes it feel more

claustrophobic for them

the boot space is probably okay but yeah

in my personal opinion it's only just

enough really for me and a family of two

children

if they did like a slightly bigger or an

estate version of this car i mean i

think it might look really weird for one

thing but that extra storage space would

be really really useful i think just a

little bit of extra space in this car

would really make a big difference now

in terms of space as a driver or as a

passenger there's a good amount of space

but again this is not the winning

feature of the polestar the uh tesla

model 3 again has much more space inside

i'd say much more storage little

compartments all of the storage spaces

available in the polestar are fairly

compact here in the middle you've got a

center armrest that lifts up and you've

got

cup holders but

that you can only really use one of them

because the other ones inside the

armrest it's so small that you can only

fit a really small drink in there this

one kind of it's fine i use it all the

time and i have no issues but it gets in

the way of your arm

you do then have the option to store a

bottle on the side inside the door and

just your left knee you have a really

useful little compartment there for

sunglasses or for something else that

you might want to store in that space so

it's absolutely fine perfectly adequate

center arm rest at the back and one

thing that i really like and actually

this is a huge thing for me is that when

you fold down that center armrest you

can you can put something that's long

through the the back from the boot into

the cabin now i don't know if you can

see it in any of the shots but i've

actually got fishing rods here i drive

around at the moment with uh usually two

or three fishing rods in the car just in

case i get a chance to go fishing

somewhere and uh if i didn't have that

um

option of of running that through from

the boot into the car i'd have to fold

those rods down every single time so if

you ever have to carry something longer

then that is an excellent feature and

it's found in many many cars but it's

something that i just i feel like if it

didn't have it it would be a massive

inconvenience

but other than that yeah storage and

practicality of the car is good it's not

something that i would say is

exceptional but perfectly adequate

so i want to talk a little bit about

over-the-air updates and uh if you've

watched my other videos then you'll have

seen this subject come up a lot ota is

the abbreviation that they seem to like

to use for over-the-air updates and it's

um something that has become

more common

uh over the last couple of years but

it's still to be honest in its infancy

really within the car industry tesla

were one of the pioneers with the

over-the-air updating functionality and

i guess when they were designing the car

they thought well how would we approach

this if we were

designing a computer

or a tablet device a bit like apple or

microsoft sony oneplus any of those

manufacturers and of course we don't

take the phone or the tablet or the

computer back to the uh to the

manufacturer for updates we don't wait

for a disc to be sent to us anymore a

usb stick a floppy disk any of those

things

it's sent to your device via the

internet and it runs an update and you

get lots of new features and everyone's

happy

so

that started to creep into the

automotive industry and into the car

industry and for manufacturers to think

oh how can we implement that same design

philosophy that will allow us to

improve and change things over time so

it it allows the makers to create a road

map they can release a vehicle a car and

and it will have its functionality but

they can have ideas in their in their

backs back of their mind concepts for

later things that they can improve on

but by designing the software and the

hardware

and the onboard computers so that they

can take advantage of that kind of

updating system it means that the

manufacturer can improve and tweak the

car over time which it does two things

it keeps the customer very very happy

and hopefully loyal customers mean that

they're more likely to come back to the

brand in the future but it also

means that the manufacturer can improve

on the vehicle and hopefully reduce the

amount of visits that the uh

the owner of the car needs to make to go

back to

the service center which uh ultimately

reduces cost

and that is a money saving exercise on a

long-term basis

so

pulstar

initially released the car without the

over-the-air update functionality and

when i when i got the car i can't

remember what it was but a few months

into the experience

i had to go back to volvo

and they installed an update

that would enable it to

update over the air in the future so if

you are getting a car now then that

isn't relevant to you but it didn't come

with that functionality to start and

they were very honest but that was

sorted out quite quickly

once that was done i'd say every few

months it's not too often it's every few

months pulsed i have released new

updates that have unlocked new features

and have made improvements that some of

them are improvements that you can

physically see and others are

improvements that you can't

so one good example is uh the car

initially didn't show you

good information on your charging speed

so you could be on a rapid charger and

you didn't know what what speed your

your car was actually charging at

so many users asked for that to be added

as a feature

and it didn't actually take Polestar very

long maybe eight months before that was

added through and over the update but

they've done even more significant stuff

more than just what you as a driver can

see behind the scenes things including

um improvements on battery heating

technology the way in which regenerative

braking works and those types of updates

are actually really really interesting

because

it means that the the manufacturer can

evolve your car over time obviously it

will get to a point where that can't be

done anymore and you know new cars and

new technology will come out but it's

it's really cool having a car that the

manufacturer can gather data from

all those cars around the world and look

at things that they can tweak and

improve through software updating and

that software updating process is

actually very simple all that will

happen is at some point it will tell you

via the tablet that you have a software

update available to install and it will

warn you that you need to allocate i

think it's an hour and a half to the

updating process so you just simply wait

till you're in a good position i mean i

don't do it while i'm out because i

there have been examples where people

have updated their car and it's actually

caused a significant problem where

they've had to have it towed and taken

back to volvo to be looked at so i tend

to do it when i'm at home because at

least i know that if it causes some

major issue i'm not stranded somewhere

but once it's installed that's it and

you can look in the user manual or on

the website and find out exactly what's

changed and what's been improved um and

in addition to the ota over the updates

you actually also get

google's own updating via the uh google

maps for example can update itself

regardless of all of that so that runs

different to the ota updates that we

talk about that's something that polstar

deal with and there's you know that's

complex software but then this android

tablet system that can also uh update

the the app for example it could be a

new version of an app that comes out

that you can install and update and

google maps will will add and move stuff

so

in fact they've moved things around

quite a bit since i've had this car

they've obviously looked at it and

thought and got feedback i thought

actually it makes more sense to have

that in this position

and something else in another position

so that's another very useful

functionality um

that they've added so i just want to

point out one of the apps that i think

that is quite important is this range

assist

i think they got lots of feedback from

customers who mentioned that that there

wasn't much information in terms of

range of what's actually going on in the

car so they added this range assist app

and i think that's really good i'll talk

about that a bit more in the range uh

section of this uh video but

being able to release new apps that are

useful to the driver are one of the

great features of these over-the-air

updates

okay so we've arrived here at a

destination in london and let's have a

look at the consumption and the range

information that we've we've had on this

drive today

so just looking at the display here it's

showing 61 miles 32.1 kilowatt hours per

100 miles

so what does that mean in the real sense

of the range so i don't know if you

recall but at the beginning of the video

it said we were going to arrive here

with 57

we actually arrived with 62 percent

battery level which is great so that

means we beat that by

uh 5

and 32.1 kilowatt hours per 100 miles i

think that's actually really good so

let's convert that to total range if you

assume 75 kilowatts uh hours is the

battery capacity of the car divide that

by 32.1 and you get 233 miles so that's

basically saying according to the trip

computer we have a theoretical range on

a drive like today where the temperature

was about eight nine degrees of 233

miles

the other way of trying to calculate the

theoretical range is to look at how far

we drove in terms of percentage so i

know this gets a little over complicated

so don't worry too much about it um but

basically we started with 90 this

morning and we got here with 62

remaining so if you take that and you

convert that to a distance per percent

we get 200 sorry we get 2.17 miles per

percent of battery times that by 100 and

you get 217 miles so there's two

different ways of trying to calculate

the theoretical range you can use the

trip computer or you can use a

percentage based method like that both a

little over the top it depends whether

you like working that kind of thing out

or not but essentially we get anything

from 217 to 233 miles so around the 220

to 230 mile range uh is basically what

we got today

now another thing i want to show you is

over here on the range assistant so

right now the range assistant is showing

a projected range of 140 miles and the

range over there on this display is 150

so you get a different number depending

on which thing you look at now the range

assistant over here is based on a

dynamic calculation

of how you've been driving but 140 miles

based on 62 so if we take 140 divided by

62 we get 2.25 and i'll show you my

calculator down here uh too much glare

in fact we get

2.25 miles per percent so it shows that

the range assistant

of the the car is is is basically yeah

it's in line with what we're actually

experiencing when we're driving so again

if i do that by 100 theoretical range of

225 miles so what i'm trying to prove

here is the drive today has given us a

theoretical range of around 220 to 230

miles and this range assistant app that

they've added to the Polestar is rarely

accurate and gives some really good

range data that is dynamic and a much

better way of figuring out what you've

got left than the range display that you

see on the main screen of the pole style

which is based on just a fixed number

and it doesn't change based on your own

driving style
