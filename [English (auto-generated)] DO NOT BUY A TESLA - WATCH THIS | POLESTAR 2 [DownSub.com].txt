surfshark is a vpn service provider that

makes internet security

simple and easily affordable it encrypts

all traffic to and from your devices

meaning that your ip address is kept

totally secret on top of that it also

blocks ads

malware phishing and all the nasties

that you really don't want we're just

going to run through some features but

do stay tuned because there's going to

be an

offer coming shortly exclusive to you

guys now i don't know about you but

during the kind of lockdown period i've

been spending a lot of time

on netflix i'm exhausting pretty much

every single show there is on netflix

sometimes you find that a particular

program isn't actually available in your

jurisdiction what surf shop can do

is enable you to access those programs

very very clever stuff

you may wonder why i'm being so birdie

about internet security well you

actually spend around six to eight hours

a day on average

online all i know i probably do if not

more and every time you're online

you're sharing personal details with

websites over hotspots and it is really

really not a good idea to allow your

personal details to escape

out into the ether and be misused by

criminals

particularly when you're on holiday or

traveling around not so much at the

moment i guess

but when you're using hotspots randomly

thieves can actually hack into those

hotspots and take your data out to that

so

surf shark will prevent that from

happening not only that but you can also

speed up

your internet ads when they pop up like

pop-ups and all the rest of it they

actually use

data they're using up screen space and

they're using up data so actually

you can speed up your internet and also

minimize the amount of data

you use on your plan little thing that

companies do online or these are big

online businesses they will be assessing

how much money you have and how affluent

you are particularly things like flight

websites

you will notice that actually depending

on who you are how many times you've

logged in how many times you've searched

it you will get different prices at

different times of the day

and depending on what network you're

joining uh surf shark

surfshot will block that meaning these

companies don't learn anything about you

and

and can't try to capitalize on your

details

and try and charge you more very very

key

now staying safe online sounds up your

street use the code below

to get up to three months free or the

equivalent of 83

off that is a limited offer that'll only

be around for a short amount of time so

get in the mix stay safe online

and let's get on with the video because

we've got a very cool car to look

through today

so let's go

[Music]

hello hello welcome back to gg tv and

more specifically ladies and gentlemen

welcome back to another electric car

review now i've been doing the rounds

recently i don't know if you've caught

many of my videos recently on electric

cars i've been doing the rounds and i've

been assessing

what all the main manufacturers have

been up to in their quest

to conquer the ev market with their

first real attempts now today

we've got a very interesting car with us

behind me here we've got the Polestar 2.

now Polestar in the uk

is a brand that isn't smattered

everywhere in fact they've only just

opened their first

physical premises in the uk as of i

think the 31st

halloween anyway their first physical

premises is open in the uk so they're

not everywhere

they're not that well known in the uk

yet but they've brought

an eevee to the market which i think

potentially is a game changer and

probably

one of the best choices you can make for

an ev right now

now that is punchy considering mercedes

are now churning out fully electric

vehicles

audi are now churning out fully electric

vehicles and bmw

are as well and of course tesla the

model 3 which is a direct

competitor to this this is a serious

shot that's been fired into the industry

and i'm keen to take you around the car

and explain exactly why i think this car

is so good

and why out of the current crop of evs

if i had to put my money somewhere

it'd probably be into one of these so

without further ado then i'm going to

introduce you to the car i'll take you

around it

and then we're going to go for a little

spin and we're going to do one of my uh

what's coined as

real world reviews which is driving

around in london using a car

as it's intended we're not going to do

any driving roads i'm not going to tell

you about understeer

oversteer or any of that prattle because

nobody really cares

most people just want an ev to drive

around in in comfort they want all the

audio to work they want the charging to

work they want the range to be good they

want it to be comfortable they want it

to be visible out the windows and they

just want a good car they

do not care how it hits apexes so

we're gonna go out and this one's got

some really special options actually

it's got a punchy

punchy performance pack added so let's

get onto the car

here we go let's kick off with the

basics this is the key just a little

kind of a rectangle plastic affair

not particularly jazzy however let's

unlock it and it does do something very

cool with the lights it's almost like

night rider there

hopefully you caught that with my camera

miss focusing i did actually buy a new

camera recently this is an upgraded one

but for some reason the autofocus is

terrible so you get a little light show

at the front and back

however a little bit of background on

polestar then they've got the polestar

one which is their 620 brake horsepower

hybrid car which is absolutely ludicrous

it's about 150k

and hopefully i'll get one of them on

the channel very soon but we're here

today to talk about the more mainstream

fully electric

Polestar 2 now Polestar as a brand

some of you may not be aware of this i'm

sure most of you will be aware of this

being car fans

the Polestar are to volvo what amg are

to mercedes

empower is to bmw rs and audi sport is

to out where you get the idea

so basically Polestar were volvo's

exciting

division making exciting punchy

performance cars and they are now

turning their hand to electric and

sustainable vehicles

but with an exciting element so a few

basics then range is about well it says

on the dash 260 miles

on a full charge i've just charged that

up overnight it will do 60

in under five seconds and i can confirm

it does actually feel ludicrously fast

and it is of course a five door but what

they call a fastback so it's not a

saloon

it's not a hatchback it's somewhere

between the two let's get the boot open

we'll have a little look around

there you go open sesame

now considering it's not an estate it's

not a saloon it's a fastback

there's a lot of room in there i'm on my

own so i'm not going to climb in but i

could if i needed to and you've

obviously got the

partition there through so far so good

it's all looking very sensible i'm going

to get on to driving in a sec

that is hell that's utter hell

completely other end of the spectrum

there

inside then you've got loads of room

please excuse the popcorn

i actually went to a cinema driving

event recently

and watched the film tenet that's how

you pronounce it i had no idea what was

going on but i took this car to a

drive-in cinema

with Polestar and fully charged sat

through the whole film

all the way home didn't run out of

battery great

this then is 300 kilowatts and as i

already said

range is as you can see 95

and 260 miles there on the dash inside

here then

it's a very stripped out simple affair

however do not let that fool you

there is some ridiculous tech in here

Polestar have completely stripped back

the interior and they have left only

essential bits in here so let's actually

hop in i'm getting very distracted

already so i'm very keen to show you

something right here this center screen

here then

is very very good it is google based so

it's not

in-house google have actually developed

this meaning it works really really well

hold on google assistant that's mental i

hate voice control stuff by the way

but this has actually changed my opinion

on it oh you got driving performance in

here chaos

there you go you can just drive along

assessing all your kind of uh

metrics but what we're going to do we're

going to google a system google

play kiss 100

all right here's kiss on your car radio

so there we go it works this is

absolutely ridiculous kiss 100 is a

radio station here in the uk for those

not aware

that was a very simple demonstration of

what it can do but i kid you not you

can't mess it around you cannot confuse

it it knows what's going on

google in this thing is really good

you've got google maps

absolutely unbelievable um and i dare

say

it works a lot better than carplay

everything is actually

really really really good this is as

good if not better than a smartphone

it's unbelievable i'm really impressed

by this and i usually hate

screens and tech and cars i just think

they're never as good as a phone

but this is the first time i've actually

seen one that works as well and the

other thing to note as well

it's portrait not landscape meaning that

when you are on sat nav

you don't have to scroll endlessly you

can see more of the road because the

horizontal ones are actually poo

so that is a good news story one gripe

as you can see down here you've only got

usbcs which i know all the brands are

doing now even rolls royce are doing it

you've only got usbcs down here

underneath these little waterproof flaps

and but you have to bring a converter if

you want a normal usb you have to bring

a converter with you

which is kind of annoying surmountable

but annoying

this particular car has got harman

kardon speakers in it again they work

extraordinarily well

you've got a tri-spoke a sporty steering

wheel with nice stitching in there as

well with all your kind of essential

commands in there

you've got a huge digital screen in

front of you giving you all the

information that you'll actually need

and none that you don't

all in all and all round you've got

vegan materials

all over the place you've got

sustainable vegan materials the seats

are bolstery but not too bad you've got

these punchy yellow seat belts which

match the calipers

which we will get onto and there's huge

pattern roof up here as well it is a

good news story in here nothing creaks

nothing rattles you prod things they

depress and make a noise that they

should do

everything is good it is very very good

i can't have a go i actually can't have

a go apart from the usb

i can't actually have a go inside at all

please ignore the snacks i haven't got a

problem i just uh

went through a drive-through cinema with

my girlfriend and crisps

in here crisps the snack variant and my

dog

come around the front of the car then

this is controversial

the logo so not many people even know

what this logo is and recently there's

been a beef

with citroen over the logo i think it's

good i don't think it looks the same as

citroen but it's very nice the way

the logo is body colored as well so it's

not standoutish there's nothing on the

grill

it's very simplistic it kind of just

says i know what i'm doing

leave me alone i like it i like the

styling

and whereas most cars are going for the

kind of pebble shaped smoothed off all

over the place

this makes a lot of use of angular

shapes which i also enjoy as well

so this car has got the performance pack

on it meaning

you've got the big wheels you've

actually got olin's adjustable dampers

which is completely bonkers

adjustable suspension dampers in there

meaning you can adjust rebound whatever

it is

ineffectively a car that is a sensible

family logger you also get these big

y-shaped

big wheels in this design and you get

brembos at the front here with gold

calipers and

most importantly you get gold dust caps

believe it or not

this is part of the performance package

gold dust caps

correct so all in all that package

actually for the huge wheels brembos

dust caps

and the adjustable suspension is only

five grand

which i think represents really nice

value for money and the gold calipers

there are picked up by the yellow seat

belts inside

i think it is a really nice touch and

the brakes work really well i think the

brembos are only on the front

they don't change the ones on the back

however the caliper on the back is

color-coded to match practicality stuff

charging then your charger spot is here

which is where you'd expect it to be

kind of same as where a petrol pump

would be very cool

use this button to release it all very

standard stuff nothing too clever

or fancy about that it does work i've

used it a lot of cars i found recently

when i'm charging them

they're a little bit uh temperamental

but this actually worked

first time if you want all the boring

charging details

then by all means hit the website but

it's up there with

all the charging times that you expect

there is lots of tech around the car

you've got a camera

in the grill on the front there to

assist with the full

parking arrangement and one of the

things i really like about this car

is the fact it's very simple the fact

that the wing mirrors here have got

no kind of bezel to them it's just

literally glass

and the mirror there so no cameras and

no kind of big bulky wing mirror

you've literally just got this really

simplistic design nothing more

than you need which kind of echoes

throughout the rest of the car

i think then now it is time to jump in

and we can talk about how much this

thing costs

what options i would go for it's very

clever because when you get in it knows

you're in

you don't need to press start or

anything like that you just kind of

obviously i'll put my seatbelt on in a

second but you just pull this very

nicely made

gear lever back

and look at that it's like yeah we're

ready where do you want to go it's

telling me off in a seat belt

let's get that on but then you're ready

to roll

no ignition no nothing it's just sitting

and then the same when you come out of

the car

you literally just put it in park

you get out and then the car knows

you've got out the car and it kind of

just turns everything off and then when

you lock it it just

yeah great right let's go for a spin

let's go then no warm-up needed off the

bat

let's get out of here so first

impressions

quiet comfortable good no squeaks no

rattles

it's not particularly jarring over bumps

and you've also got some really nice

settings in the menu here as well in the

car settings so you can adjust

everything

from the ambient lighting through to

even how heavy the steering is so you've

got even

um light steering heavy steering

standard

it's good depending on how you're

feeling if you're feeling particularly

strong or if you like

a little bit more steering weight you

can obviously adjust that

you can also adjust things like the

regen so you can turn that off

completely

or you can go full one pedal driving

mode which i'm in most of the time i

quite enjoy

which effectively means when you come

off the accelerator like now

the car feels like it's on the brakes

but what it's actually doing is

regenerating

electricity into the battery which is

really really clever

and it really makes you think about your

driving it i think it does improve you

as a driver you become

a smoother driver you really got to

modulate your

acceleration input which is cool and i

think when you come out of this car

you go into a normal ice car it actually

makes you

a little bit more smooth it's cool and

it's fun just seeing whether you can

just drive around willy-nilly without

having to touch the brakes at all

and obviously doing so means that you

get more range out of it because every

time you slow down or you stop

you're putting power back into the

battery like now i'm coming up to a

left-hander

i'm off the accelerator i'm turning in

and then i'm back on the gas again

no brakes whatsoever usual boring gripes

with cars things like bluetooth

connectivity

uh parking sensors visibility bluetooth

is unbelievable it connects

instantly and it knows exactly what you

want i think that comes from the fact

that it's basically

a huge really far advanced

smartphone in the center of the dash

high five as i said before is very good

visibility is fantastic you can pretty

much see

everything you need to the back windows

aren't great they aren't great

but there's definitely a nicer sensation

to drive around you definitely feel a

lot more

alert and where you are compared to the

mercedes eqc which i reviewed recently i

really didn't like that car

i hope i wasn't being unfair but i just

wasn't

a massive fan of it i wasn't impressed

and considering

the size of mercedes compared to a brand

like polestar

polstar i've nailed it they've

absolutely nailed it and they've kind of

made brands like mercedes and even audi

with their e-tron

kind of made them look a little bit

silly considering the budget

and the development that they've got at

their disposal and a brand like polestar

or being not a tiny brand

they have made them look a little bit

silly and if this is polestar's

first kind of foray into the electric

world

i think good things are coming i really

do think good things are coming because

this is their first attempt

this arguably is going to be their worst

car that they make this is going to be

their worst tv and it is by no means

uh faultable in any way shape or form i

physically cannot

fault it at all price starts at 46

000 pounds in the uk obviously if you

add the big hi-fi and you add

the performance pack which is 5 000

pounds it quickly does

bump up quite quickly uh in the uk i

think you get three grand off

government grant for as long as that's

going to last who knows at the moment

um but all in all i think the one that

i'm driving around in comes to about 52

000 pounds

which is not cheap but it's also not

that expensive as well and there's also

pulsed our lease and kind of

funding options as there tends to be

with these cars that includes a

three-year warranty three-year service

plan

uh and three-year kind of connectivity

and

updates from polestar as well so you're

pretty much completely sorted

for at least three years whether you can

extend that i don't know

whether these things are reliable i

don't know however i have been running

this for a week

and there hasn't been one error light

that hasn't been one glitch

there's been nothing absolutely nothing

wrong with it at all i haven't heard any

grumblings on the grapevine that these

things are falling apart

and certainly it doesn't feel like a car

uh that's going to fall apart

the build quality definitely surpasses

that of my experiences in tesla's

and all in all i am very very impressed

by it range might be a bit of a bug bear

at about 260 270 miles uh

claimed but realistically i haven't

found it an issue and i don't think

you'd probably find it an issue

in the uk because there isn't really

many things

further than 260 miles away in the uk

and again

any gripe to do with range will probably

be related to infrastructure

and not the range itself should

infrastructure be there in the uk and be

good enough then a 260 mile range should

be more than enough

i know tesla are coming out with kind of

a 500 mile plus ranges

uh in their plaid mode model s

but for now i don't think this is

bad news and with charging technology

kind of increasing every single day

and then more and more charges all over

the place and even sneaking them into

lampposts

i don't see it as an issue now an

important element of this car image

i know a lot of evs driving around you

see people driving evs and you think

they're virtually signaling or they kind

of look like

some sort of melted pebble or they look

like a typewriter or something like that

but this is actually

i think just goes enough shut up i think

it goes under the radar enough that it's

actually quite cool

it's not you're not kind of shouting

about the fact you're driving an

electric car

the charging flap looks like a petrol

cap for those not really in the know

this just looks like a normal car

there aren't any electric badges on it

there's no kind of lightning bolts

everywhere there's no kind of green wing

mirrors to tell everyone you're you're

driving electric car

it's just an understated cool and

actually quite a rare brand at the

moment i haven't seen another one of

these driving around so

all in all good news would i choose

white no i would probably choose black

and actually i spec one up

on the configurator before coming out i

went for black with the performance pack

uh and i think i just went for the

standard interior as well you can get a

beige

with wood everywhere but i think that i

probably would just go for this actually

in here it's quite a nice shade of gray

it's gonna be relatively hard wearing

particularly with a smelly dog like mine

so i think that's where i go with it the

color is actually called void i think

instead of black

and that is a free option by all means

though the configurator is really good

they've got a 360 option inside and out

so do have a little play around on there

i would go for the big hi-fi

it is very good but other than that i'd

probably leave my stuff alone they do

come relatively well equipped

despite the lack of buttons it does

actually do literally everything

other considerations like after sales

and residuals

don't know it's still too new a brand to

know about anything like that

however with the volvo links i don't

think there's going to be a lack of kind

of funding or availability of parts

this brand is huge in scandinavia and

reliability wise

on volvos have been incredible so i

don't think this will be

any different however i could be wrong i

just don't know enough as i say it is a

relatively new brand this is a

relatively new car

but there's no reason to be any more

alarmed than you would be in a tesla and

in fact i'd probably back this

over a tesla in regards to falling apart

so yeah it's a good news story i'm

trying to think of some gripes i'm

trying to think of something to have a

go at it about

i love the pound roof as well driving in

here was just so airy it's just so quiet

it's just a nice place to be

would it be more comfortable on the

smaller wheels possibly

is it crashy though no it's good

it is good i'm very pleased a really

irrelevant point now the indicator click

on this thing it's really really

satisfying

i don't know if you're gonna be able to

pick it up

it's got this really nice like dull

clicking noise to it

it's just very satisfying i don't know

maybe i'm on the spectrum

i just enjoy it a quick note on

performance before i disappear

i mean i'm in a 30 zone round here and

this is where this car is probably going

to live

a lot of its life it does do b roads

well

it does do motorways well it is fast

mid-range is

instant punch as i said at the beginning

of the video 60 is under 5 seconds

it's quick it is a fast car and it does

handle very well particularly with the

olin shocks now i haven't messed around

adjusting the shocks you need to get

under the car to do that and i'm not

that bothered about that sort of thing

on the whole but it's very cool to know

that you can do that

and i guess it's just a willy waving

fact that you can adjust the shocks

on your ev it is a pub willy waving fact

and for that i very much enjoy it and

it's just a really

nice detail and as i said before it does

represent really good value for money

because a new set of shocks

even for my 996 was about three and a

half grand

the kw shocks a new set of wheels any

20s or 21s

they're going to set you back a few

grand as well and you've got your gold

valve cap so i think the whole lot for

five grand if you wanted to do it

yourself

you wouldn't be able to do it that cheap

so i do think that option

is well worth doing particularly if this

is going to be your main car

and has something you want to give a

little bit of a spirit to drive on the

weekend and not just

be a family logger i think that does do

a lot to introduce a wider breadth of

ability and an element of performance

and enjoyability

to the car for a little additional extra

also

i do think that cars spec with that

option residually will be better news

so it will aid the resale so i think

that option

is well worth speccing and it's a really

nice touch from Polestar

to introduce that to the configurator so

uh well done then

it's the first time i've ever seen that

on any kind of even remotely

sensible car like this so yeah really

cool hats off to them on that

i'm gonna pull in then and then the

review hopefully that provided some

insight into a car that isn't

hugely talked about in the uk but you

will see

a lot of these on the roads very soon i

have teased this car

on my instagram and i've had a hell of a

lot of dms from people saying they've

ordered one of these and they're eager

to hear all about it

deliveries for these are starting

imminently i think december

january 2021 for the earliest cars but

they're going to start pouring out

over the next year or so so do keep your

eyes peeled for these on the road

and do let me know if you want me to

review the Polestar one because there

is one

in polestar's press fleet i believe that

i may be able to get my hands on

so fingers crossed i can take that out

and give it a proper boot

because that is a lot more performance

driven as i say at 620 brake horsepower

and 60 in only a few seconds so that is

gonna be right it is a hybrid

not a fully electric car so completely

different it's three door

and i'd love to get my hands on it so

you may well see that on the channel at

some point

but for now from me and the Polestar 2

thank you very much for watching

do subscribe give me a thumbs up and do

share this video around as it really

really helps

these videos reach more people and it

helps me churn cheers guys
