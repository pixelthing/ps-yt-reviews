[Music]

hey guys what's up it's joe rady from

rainy's rise we're back at one of my

favorite parking lot locations because

guess what this is actually a first time

review of this particular vehicle of any

type here on radies rides this is it

this is the new 2022 Polestar our

particular one is the dual motor long

range performance model but before we

get into this sportback design yes it

does have a hatchback style

let's talk about what's going on here

Polestar they are a subsidiary of volvo

we have featured some volvo products

here on radies rise really built a name

for themselves all about safety what's

interesting is that pulse star used to

really be their performance motor sports

branch and then because of the industry

moving towards electrification volvo saw

an opportunity to create Polestar as

being their electrification

lead into the market now the Polestar

comes in many different forms this

particular one is a dual motor setup you

could get a single motor setup if that's

what you want to do with your

electrification or you could even go for

an ultra high performance example one

thing is for certain you don't have to

go

tesla if you want an electrified vehicle

there's other luxury vehicles out there

like this polestar bring in the style

bring in the luxury touches inside but

also bring in some performance so what i

want to find out is is this

the best luxury

electric vehicle to buy is it better

than the tesla model 3 let's go ahead

let's dive into our Polestar and find

out right off the bat very unique

styling really separates it from the

rest of the pack and really you can see

the volvo connection there especially at

the front of the business what you're

gonna get is thor's hammer

that way of them signifying their design

with their led daytime running lamp and

turn signal you see the hammer there

thor's hammer get it and then you're

gonna get a multi-led beam setup up top

and then a projector

beam on the bottom portion that is

adaptive so what that means is it's

actually going to move with the steering

now working your way down there is some

gloss black but the good news is instead

of being a fake vent they actually put

some led fog lamps in there now there is

a little bit of flat black along the

bottom the gloss black gets pinched down

until you meet the grill area but the

good news is no fake vents on the side

now coming across the front grille pull

star uses a very intricate design these

flat black squares with a little bit of

gloss black in the vertical slots you do

have a forward-facing camera i like the

nice aluminum style finish that they put

and then there's a little bit more of

that gloss black that came from the

sides into the front grill area

and then of course you're going to get

this flat black splitter to help with

aerodynamics very very low coefficient

of drag and that's important because

drag is going to take away range and

with this they really want to maximize

the range now you do have a liquid

cooled lithium ion battery and because

this is the long-range dual motor we

have all-wheel drive a motor up front

and a motor out in the back now when we

get up onto the low slung hood i like

the way they did the indentations on

both sides just enough style to separate

it from tesla for sure

and from the other

brands that are european that are moving

towards electrification like bmw with

the ix

and the i4 now coming around the bend

what do we have wheel and tire set up

you're going to get these 19-inch wheels

simple design but you like i said you

could see the volvo connection in there

machine aluminum gloss black there's

your Polestar badge that we saw on the

front of the vehicle there it is on the

center caps you do have regenerate

braking and if you go with the full

super performance version you will get

massive brembo calipers now the one

thing i am going to zonk is i'm not

digging the flat black around the fender

treatment i think at this level of

vehicle and being a Polestar it should

be all color matched but i do like the

indentation that they put at the top of

the fender to really give it that extra

element of style and if you're wondering

well joe what's the size of the tires on

this thing 245 on the width and a 45

series sidewall like i said we have

all-wheel drive because we got the dual

motor set up now coming down the side

you're going to get color matched on the

side mirrors we have the led turn

signals and then i like the way that

they blacked out the a-pillars and then

instead of having a panoramic sunroof

per se we just have a whole glass roof

really like the way just total glass

everything else looking slick we got

color mesh on the door handles and then

you'll see they put a little bit of a

designator this is a Polestar 2

battery electric vehicle it even tells

you the kilowatts and everything of the

setup on here now this lower indentation

looks great gives it that extra element

of style a little bit of flat black

along the sill and like i said i wish

that that was full just body color match

gloss black around the window treatment

and i'm digging the shape of the windows

notice how low the side glass is but how

elongated it is very very unique style

coming towards the rear you got your

charge port door easy to get to you just

plug it right in there and that's going

to charge your pulse star 2 and then

closing it up one two three working your

way towards the back this is that lift

back sport back hatchback design so

instead of there just being a regular

trunk this whole portion is gonna raise

up

love the way they did the tail lights

the led not only turn singles but the

taillights and everything kind of wraps

around to the other side there's our

Polestar badge looking good and then

going all the way down they do put a

little bit of aluminum finish like we

saw on the grill to kind of balance it

out i'm just there's just too much flat

black on this on this vehicle a lot of

flat black on the lower portion but

other than that this top portion of the

trunk that hatchback area looks fan

freaking tastic but why don't we go

ahead let's pop the hood and talk

horsepower numbers on this Polestart

too all right guys we got the hood open

you do have a little cubby area you can

put the charging cord up here if you

choose to do so or this would be a

perfect place you could literally put

four to six boxes of twinkies up here

you got your jack and then you actually

remove this

to showcase your electric air pump and

the goo

in case you have a flat so there's no

spare on board this Polestar 2 but

let's talk about what is on board and

what you're going to find underneath all

that sheet metal is like i said two

motors you're looking at two electric

motors combined producing 408 horsepower

487 pound-feet of torque with a direct

drive transmission 0-60 in about 4.4

seconds quarter mile is going to zoom by

at 12.7 seconds and you get a top speed

of 127 miles per hour the range with the

dual motor setup is 249 miles the

vehicle weighs 2 000 excuse me 4 700

pounds if you want a single rear wheel

motor that is going to be front-wheel

drive and it's going to give you over

300 miles of range now the great news is

you have a multi-link rear suspension

out back

and then of course charging charging

time if you're using ac is going to be 8

hours if you're using a dc fast charger

in 33 minutes you could go from 10

percent battery life to 80 percent

battery life but definitely nice to have

the variety in either going single motor

dual motor or even going high

performance but while we go ahead if

you're ready i'm ready let's check out

the interior and see how this volvo or

should i say Polestar stacks up against

the tesla

all right guys we're inside this

Polestar 2

new for 2022 dual motors first time

we're bringing a Polestar on radies

rides and a lot of you have asked for it

so i'm glad to finally bring it to you i

know you're saying to yourself well joe

this Polestar

has my curiosity it has my interest

i think it may have my wallet because

i'm really digging it especially over

the teslas how much is it though so this

particular one the way that it's

optioned has an msrp of 57 thousand

dollars let's see what you get for the

money to the door panels you're going to

notice nice smooth touch material i like

the soft touch up top

the darker gray looks great besides

black and if you're wondering well what

is that material it's actually called

weave tech it's almost like a wetsuit

material easy to keep clean you've got

your speaker grille cover there in the

center and then down below you've got a

good size pocket easily for two

smoothies

and a glass of carrot juice as well to

really cleanse the body now going from

the door panel to the dash same story we

got soft touch material i like the way

they have the speaker grill style

material on the center here some dark

open pour wood a little bit of gloss

black but they did a great job styling

the ac vents on the corners and then

what do you get when you get to the

center stack first of all we got our

center speaker up top that's our harman

kardon system and then what's really

bizarre is they got ac vents

up top pointed towards the windshield

which actually work once you direct them

towards you this is our 11.2 inch

vertical screen set up in here you got

google maps all touchscreen capability

no no actual physical buttons now let me

show you some of the features you got

full high resolution cameras we pull up

360 you could actually click

on whatever area you want to highlight

to make sure you're not going to scratch

your brand new pulse star when you're

parking it and then it's easy to get

right back we could go into car settings

now what's kind of a zonk is they showed

the high performance pulse star i wish

though that we had that one right now

but i'm sure that we'll get it

eventually in the drive settings you

could actually adjust the level of

steering feel whether you want light

standard or firm you can go into sport

mode

also do the one pedal drive and what's

nice is that they have a low setting and

a standard setting for that one pedal

drive that's when you release the

throttle and the brakes are

automatically uh applied you got your

creep feature no not for you to be a

creep but for when you're sitting in

traffic we could go into all the

different assistants here

the way that

each of this piece of technology assists

you you could shut it off and turn on

what i like is they actually put

physical pictures to let you know what

each of these aids are as you're turning

them on and off charge you can see how

much charge you have and when you're

when you're and then you could also when

you're charging you can adjust how full

you want it to go let's say you're in a

rush and you only want to get 10 more

percent put it on 70. put it on 90 or

you can keep it on full 100 and you go

into more and we got more things like

car status no warning all is good thank

you polestar i appreciate that and you

go right back to where you started tons

of icons all like i said contain within

the infotainment system and then we'll

go ahead and pull the maps back up ac

same story you're going to do everything

on the screen so it is a little

cumbersome to use at first but then it's

not so bad we got heated seats but no

ventilated seats so that is a zonk but

we do have a heated steering wheel which

is great and like i said

to get to where you're going it's real

real simple and then the maps are back

working your way down we do have

wireless charging which is great this is

going to be your actual knob for radio

control

so at least they give you that and then

this is going to be the electric shifter

for the direct drive transmission look

at how it has the polestar logo lit up

just a little bit of gloss black but you

really shouldn't be touching that

because of the high edges we have a

single cup holder and within that cup

holder is your key fob all black with

the buttons

there you go easy to use you got more of

that weave tech material open this guy

up another cup holder so you can put

your uh super slurpee so you you don't

want to go healthy and go with a jamba

juice you could go with a super slurpy

and then the seats this material is

really durable this weave tech very

comfortable and it looks super sporty of

course you're going to have electric

assist for the passenger i have electric

assist for the driver

you even have of course the front

hammies

and we got look at this a banana holder

on the side

for when you want to get that extra

potassium

if you don't like bananas you could eat

your broccoli i'd rather go bananas

because broccoli's not my fave and then

our full glass roof now the one thing

about this is that there's no shade fort

so i'm curious on a hot summer florida

day what's it gonna feel like in here am

i gonna feel like i'm sitting in a

microwave but come on over to the

business end i to show you behind this

leather wrapped steering wheel and i got

a nice digital gauge instrumentation

cluster i want to show you coming up

guys business time behind the wheel you

do have a simple silt plate

that looks really clean with the pole

star badge to let you know what vehicle

you bought each and every time you get

in

nice seat controls two memory seat

settings which are great so you can let

somebody borrow your Polestar i'm gonna

move this back a little bit and kind of

out of the way steering wheel perfect

thickness you do have gloss black switch

gear on the steering wheel horn button i

wish they would do something a little

bit more it's a little bland here but i

do like the way they have the polestar

badge there's a little bit more gloss

black it is manual tilting and

telescoping steering wheel and then dash

you're gonna get that nice clear digital

display there's your google maps there

it lets you know your range your power

your charge and then watch this you hit

the button and now it makes the map go

away and you have your clear

instrumentation one two three

look at that like the way they have that

easy setup there other than that

everything else feels very car esque in

here and i like that because like in the

tesla everything is in the infotainment

system i don't like that and here it

makes a lot more sense but why don't we

get into the back seat and see how your

passenger is going to enjoy the room in

this Polestar 2. guys backseat time it's

really interesting because the door

panels come up kind of high because

remember how i showed you how the glass

was kind of short but it was elongated

but because of the glass roof in here it

really feels a lot more open and

spacious than what it really is so

that's really interesting you got that

weave tech material very durable a

little bit of plastic

but the good news is you do have pockets

now the bad news is it is the cargo net

but you could easily put at least four

uh pieces of non-bread back there we do

have your ac vents and i like the way

that they designed them to mimic what's

up front we also have two usbc's and

heated seats

the material is soft and then to really

wrap things up you get a nice super

sized armrest can easily put two cups of

hummus in here and a couple uh crackers

to really just enjoy that hummus maybe

some carrot sticks but you know what

we proved that there's space in the

backseat of this Polestar 2 let's go

check out the cargo area and see what we

can haul in our electrified poles it's

time to get in the back of the polestar

i'm going to go ahead and push the

button you can see how you have that

hatchback sportback design and that's

going to really free you up for a ton of

room in the back seat area there is a

12-volt you have a pass-through and the

seats will do a 60-40 split which is

great

plus you got plenty of room and you're

gonna have that versatility of having

that lift back design but you know what

it's about that time

yeah i'm ready are you ready to find out

what this Polestar is all about let's

go on throttle in our pull start all

right guys we're in this 2022 Polestar

2

dual motor

with a little over 400 horsepower now

what i did was i went ahead and put it

into sport mode i have steering feel on

firm i like a heavier style feel and

then for one pedal drive i have the

regenerator braking on low there is

standard i wanted to try low because i

don't want too much braking done by the

car i want to be able to do the braking

but from a dead stop we're going to go

on throttle if you're ready i'm ready

here we go

wow

here we go so this is what an electric

vehicle is all about is that instant

torque

instant power

this thing handles really well with

having that battery nice and low

in the chassis

brakes feel good

nice and balanced

super whisper quiet that's for sure

nice look at this

wow

so let's talk about what's going on here

really felt planted having the all-wheel

drive with the two motors i really think

is the way to go because you're going to

get that planted feel no matter

what the surface is doing getting to

that little over 11 inch infotainment

system screen is really easy

as you can see having the glass roof

really makes it open bright and airy in

here and the seats are ultra comfortable

i'm really digging

this

special material because it feels good

but i know it's gonna also wear well on

top of that

visibility side mirrors are great i love

the way on the side mirrors you'll

notice how the glass goes all the way to

the perimeter of the actual side mirror

housing you don't see that very often

there's usually some kind of you know

space there or gap

out the back it's interesting it's a

little tight but they kind of carve a

section out to give you a little bit

better rear wood visibility so that's uh

important and then the gauges are easy

to read easy to understand um whether

you have the maps up the google maps or

not really easy to understand all at a

glance all right guys once again from a

desktop here we go on throttle

it really push you back in the seat

obviously

and definitely get you going very

quickly

steering feedback is great

nice and balanced in the chassis and

this is the work that Polestar has done

with the motorsports program and

everything else

but i'm loving the balance of the car

it's nice and solid well put together

especially when you compare it to

a tesla model 3 or model y the fit and

finish in here is so much nicer plus the

really cool thing is you don't see any

of these so it's like you're really

driving something that people are like

hey

what is that and i really like that i

think that's part of the fun of having

an electric vehicle especially right now

as things are booming and more companies

are joining the party that there's

vehicles that you just don't see

and people are like hey they're very

very curious so that's been the really

cool thing

it's crazy how those ac vents that i

pointed out on top of the dash actually

bring air to you because you think it

would just cool the windshield but it

actually directs it very nicely in here

and then like i said going through the

different modes shutting off sport mode

and

adjusting the steering fill and

everything is very very simple

and i like the fact that you could find

out

real quick what your range is how much

uh power are you using and then also the

regen braking as well all right guys

what i wanted to do is i wanted to give

you a little bit of a bird's eye view of

what i'm seeing as we're driving down

the road like i said you could see where

you could easily make all your

adjustments i do have the steering feel

on firm but you could go to standard one

two three like that and you could also

do the one pedal drive

easy on and off

low or high and you got that creep

feature for when you're in traffic now

to get back to google maps real easy

fills up the screen nicely and i could

also bring it up

on the digital instrumentation cluster

there but even over all these bumps and

whatnot the multi-link rear suspension

outback works super well and they did a

great job with communicating feedback to

the wheel which is hard to do a lot of

times especially with a lat electric uh

steering system

you're gonna lose some of that feedback

but uh definitely

a car that's well thought out

and something that's very usable with

that uh liftback activity

of the hatch but uh i throw here we go

then i can bring up the speed a little

bit larger

get out and then it shows you we're now

braking because i got the one pedal

braking on and the regen charging is

taking place

so real nice to have it that simple it

doesn't need to be ultra complicated and

it's the setup like this that makes you

feel like you're used to this because it

feels like the cars that you have been

driving for the past few years having

actual instrumentation having the

separate infotainment system rather than

like on tesla's where everything is in

the infotainment system but hopefully

this is giving you a nice overall feel

of what the Polestar 2 is all about for

2022. we're gonna get back to where to

all-star and wrap this one up so i'll

see in a split second hi guys it's been

a wonderful day with this Polestar 2 i

definitely want to thank everybody at
