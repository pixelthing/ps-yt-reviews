this is a Polestar 2 and in this video

i'm gonna show you guys and tell you

guys seven things

i really really really love about this

car

the infotainment system in the pollstar

2 is something i've spoken about in so

many videos at this point that it

shouldn't be a surprise to anybody

that it is on this list but it's

so apparent especially after hopping in

and out of

so many vehicles i mean the past few

months

past six months that it's so

clear how good this infotainment system

is first off i mean

the screen quality is superb this size

is just perfect it's not too big and

dominating and it's not

so small that you know the icons are

tiny look at all these icons they're so

big you know just adjusting the

temperature it's so simple

you have the temperature there you just

press minus or plus and then you can

also go into

the fan going into the you know settings

for the hvac and then you can actually

do adjust the speed

on the auto setting on at the fan

that is pretty pretty cool that is you

know a poster or a volvo thing and then

you all

have all your tiles here you have your

maps you have your you know your uh

spotify but you can also go in here and

then you can customize and then you have

your vehicle settings

and then that looks like a camera so

that's a camera and then you have your

home button here

i mean it's so simple and intuitive and

if that wasn't enough it has the best

voice command

in the world so i'm going to do the

prompt now

of the infotainment system so if you

have a device at home

that looks like this icon yeah i'm going

to

say that now so you guys are warned hey

google

okay that's kind of funny that the car

can't even pronounce

Polestar okay uh no pun intended that's

quite funny but i mean it's so

easy to use this infotainment system

because the voice command is

so good and yeah i mean it's a

no-brainer that the infotainment system

on this car is on this list

the steering wheel controls and buttons

are

super easy to use very legible

large and just logically laid out i mean

i'm

never confused even how many cars i

drive hopping back into the Polestar 2

is just a breeze

to use on the left side you have your

adaptive cruise control buttons your

pilot assist so you turn on the system

here

you set your speed here you also do the

minus there

you can resume your speed there and then

you can set your distance it's

super easy and then on the right side

skip forward

track skip backward volume up and down

and then you have your board computer

and then you have your voice commands

but you don't even need to press

that button i mean the layout the way

they are just you know labeled and how

big

and easy they are to read just make it

super simple and i just

love it for that you don't have to make

it complicated you know often

the easy way is the best way

one of the things i absolutely love

about the Polestar 2

is the volume knob so first off the fact

that it actually has

a volume knob in 2021 seems to be

a dying breed but not only that the

placement of it

right here in front of the shifter so

it's so easy to use you're resting your

hand here

and then it's the way it rotates

i mean it's so nice and clicky and just

satisfying to use so yeah

i absolutely commend polestar for

including this i hope they keep this in

every of their future cars

then right behind the volume knob we

have

the shifter so first off again the fact

that it actually has a shifter

being in 2021 this seems to be a dying

thing in evs and i really don't get it

because i'm a huge fan of

some mechanical interaction you know

just because cars seem to be going eevee

now in the future more and more ev

models more and more pure evs i don't

understand why we are getting

rid of this it worked so well for so

many decades

you don't have to you know fix a clock

that isn't

broken and keep the shifter so the

placement they put it in the middle they

made it simple they made it quite cool

you know

being lit up and stuff like that but

they put it here in the center console

and not up here yes you can argue that

it would be more practical if it was

another place

and i wouldn't mind if they just put it

to the side and maybe you know put the

cup holders here instead

instead of back here but yeah we've

spoken enough about the cup holders of

this car or the rather

lack of practicality but you know just

interacting with this

every time you get into the car putting

it into drive

putting it into reverse and even just

pressing the park button is

such a satisfying experience i just

love that this car has a traditional

shifter

in the traditional place

these are some of the best seats in

the whole automotive industry i mean if

they are

that good and we all know that volvo are

known for having well some of the best

seats in

the automotive industry and these are

lifted right out of the volvo xc40

it's no surprise but what really

surprises me is that

how good they actually are and i really

didn't

notice it or you know think much about

it before

you know jumping in and out of all these

different cars

and you know my audi seats are quite

nice

these are much better the jaguar i-pace

i recently had had you know quite good

seats though the support

is is uh you know not the best so the

reason that i think these are so good

is so first off the initial cushion is

is quite soft so even if you you know

sit on them for

you know a whole day you don't get you

know lower

back pains or lower bottom pains that

you usually do

with hard but supported seats so they

are soft enough

that they just give you that initial

cushion but again

they are also supportive enough you know

the the way that these are contoured

it's amazing i just have support in my

lower back

in my upper back in my thighs

you know you can extend the the thigh

and stuff like that

it's just you know the seat comfort and

how

good they support your body i mean these

these are amazing so you could start

with a car

that gives you bad back and then you can

get into this car

after a few days you're cured they are

so good

in my opinion the Polestar 2 is the

perfect size for

european cities i mean it's not so long

or so wide that it makes

parking you know a hassle like something

in my audi each round which is quite

big you know uh trying to park it but it

isn't

so small that it's unpractical because

you actually have you know a sizable

back seat

the trunk is big enough so i mean the

footprint

is is perfect for european cities it's

just

the right size and every time you know

i'm going out

especially into town i rather take this

than my audi e-tron because it's so much

easier to

drive around in the city and to park

the one pillow driving feature here in

the Polestar 2

is one of the best calibrated one pedal

driving features of any ev

i have ever driven it may even be better

than what tesla are doing in their model

so

you can adjust you know the one pedal

ferocity

if you want to call it that you can turn

it off you can put it too low or too

standard yes this is in norwegian

and you can even turn off and on creep i

like creep

off and standard one pillow driving

because it is quite aggressive

so you just you know go on the throttle

and then when you

go off the throttle it comes to a

complete stop

and it's quite aggressive so you don't

even have to use the brakes

and what is even nicer is that you don't

even have to use the brakes to

you know parallel parks so you can just

go like this and then you can go into

reverse

look at that i'm not even i'm not even

touching the brake

look at that look at that that's so good

so you can easily

parallel park without having to even

go off the throttle just keep your foot

on the throttle like that look at that

that is so so satisfying yeah so

i really do love the one pedal driving

in the Polestar 2 because it works just

as good

and even better than most evs you know

in how aggressive it is and that

comes to a complete stop the fact that

you don't even have to you know

go off the throttle to shift between

reverse and drive so you can actually

parallel park it makes it

so easy and a breeze to use

so there we go guys those were seven

things i really

really really love about

the Polestar 2 and i mean i really

really really love

those things because it just makes

driving and living with this car

such a breeze and it's so apparent after

you know hopping out of an eevee that's

good but not as good you know when it

comes to these details as

this car it just really elevates the

poster too and i like this car

more than ever so guys i hope you
