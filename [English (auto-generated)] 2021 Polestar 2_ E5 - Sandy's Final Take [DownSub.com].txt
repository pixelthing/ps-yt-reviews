well hey boys and girls

thanks for coming back to mineral life

and uh this is our little wrap

up for the Polestar 2 um

i will tell you right off the bat i do

like this car

um i'm going to go through the good news

bad news and what i do like and what i

don't care for

but in essence um in in in

in a in a whole statement if you like

this is a

this is a car that will be a real

contender for tesla

um so far this is the one that i think

could have the most legs so what do i

like about this car

first off um i like the looks i like the

um

i like the uh the mustang it's kind of

an aggressive look

and um this is definitely kind of uh

in between um aggressive which is what

the

what the mustang looks like and um

and um happy if you want to use that

term or feminine

for the um for the um for the tesla

this car is somewhere in between it's

like um

happy aggressive i like the fact that

this is quick

it's very fast um i don't think it's as

fast as the tesla but i think it's equal

to the

mustang um it's very responsive

i would have never guessed with a with a

rear twist axle

or sorry twist beam and um

and the uh basically coil over shock

that i would have got the ride that i

got

out of this car i it's surprisingly good

it's very responsive especially if you

put it on firm

i like the fact that i can do one foot

braking

or one foot driving i should say this

car really works

really quite well this works as good as

a tesla when it comes to that

i like the fact that there's plenty of

back seat room

it's um this is a very uh roomy kind of

a vehicle

um then we talk about the frunk and the

in the trunk uh both of them um

are are at least there and they're kind

of roomy

they could be bigger though when we

started digging underneath here

we found that there was more room and

and i don't know why they didn't take

advantage of that room

and like i pointed out when we were

looking at the rear suspension

the uh the uh the trunk could have gone

down further

and taken the price of a bla a bracket

so we would have

uh the the buyer would have got a bigger

a bigger trunk and they would have got

rid of

a piece of steel that's used as a cross

member that c-channel

steel so i would have changed that

i like the transitional control system

that's

that's inside the ip for the screens to

the ip

that's been very popular with some of

the people who've never driven a tesla

or

actually never driven an electric

vehicle before they like that

they like that there's something in

front of them that tells them

what's going on and they don't have to

continuously look to the side

personally i don't that really didn't do

it for me

i like the fact that there's a that

there's

a few controls up there that i need to

look at periodically

but for the most part um i think that

this is a good a very good transitional

vehicle

um i like the fact that there's gas

shocks

in the front i i don't know why

uh other car companies

would even dream of putting in a prop

rod

i i mean what why would you do that i

mean this is so much

so much cleaner and easier i would have

changed this

from um i would have i would have opened

the front with uh something on the uh

something on the ip or one of the

controls inside as opposed to having a

lever

i don't like levers and i don't

understand why it is that i

i have to have one of these when tesla

doesn't do it

i mean really so there's a couple of

things here that maybe we could change

people make mistakes and this is

impossible to make a mistake on

it's a little thing but it makes a big

deal and uh

and after hearing about people making

mistakes with

washer bottles and brake fluid and

whatnot that's

that's not good so let's talk about

some of the bad things so let's swing

over here

i um i find this car slightly

uncomfortable to drive

because the accelerator pedal is now the

only thing that i'm using

um in this car and that

console gets in the way for me um i

don't like the

cup holder i i don't like the fact that

i have to flip something up

into the back seat in order to get to

the second cup holder i don't know

what they were thinking here but that's

that's not a that's not a good idea

i think the rear window is way too small

i i was really shocked at how little

room there is there now i realized too

that

everybody's using the uh the backup

cameras uh

or the rear cameras to uh to do a lot of

the driving now

and that's fine but um for me

the rear window was uh was a little too

small

number one complaint are you kidding me

why why after looking at this look at

how clean this is

this is like spectacular the one thing i

can say for sure

is that the mustang got it right with

this

i love this i absolutely

love the idea that i don't have door

handles and i bet you every stylist on

the planet is the same way

so we look at it a little bit further

then there's the um

then there's the fact that uh it's not

really bad news but

it's news this is the first real

competitor to tesla and it's chinese

people keep telling me oh yeah the

chinese will never ever

don't believe that for a second i'm old

and i remember when the japanese showed

up and i remember hearing

all kinds of executives saying things

like

oh the japanese can have the small car

market they'll never understand

trucks and luxury and full size bull

these guys see these gaps here

this is not an accident okay these

this car is really well made and for the

first

this is this car is um is uh built by

volvo but volvo is owned by Geely and

julie is a chinese company

and they make very good cars in china

and actually in lots of other parts of

the world so

geely is known for making good cars

volvo is well known for making safe

safe cars that women like to drive and

these guys got their heads together and

they produce something that's really and

truly

like i say this is the first real

competitor

i can see to uh to to tesla

so um like i say this is

a this is a really good car i think that

um

i think that the other oems out there

uh they better have their head screwed

on really tight because

if this is the first invader if you like

to say

then um then

the that mustang and uh

and definitely volkswagen they better

really check these out because

these cars all cost about the same

amount of money

but for the value and for the um

and for the market that they're trying

to capture

um you don't have a frunk hmm

really you you you don't give me gas

shocks

hmm really you don't go really fast

really it's not going to take long for

people to sort out

which things they like and which they

don't and i'm going to tell you

this car is going to sell

i think that that one's going to do well

as well but the problem is there's only

50 000 of these going to be made this

year

and i really don't like the fact that

people are using the word

mexican mustang i'd uh

i don't like that sort of uh talk

but i love this this car this car did

really well

this car did phenomenally well but i'm

still a tesla fan

anyhow that's all i don't want to go any

further than that

thanks very much for watching keep

tipping those cashiers

thank you for for those people who've

started signing up again with um

as subscribers uh we really appreciate

it we don't normally ask but

uh but i i just like to say thank you

for for doing that

see you again soon

[Music]

you
