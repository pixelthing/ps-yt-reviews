that we like the Polestar 2 here at

electrifying it's subtle but it is good

looking it's got loads of great features

there's lots to recommend it and this is

a brand new version how is it new well

i've had a game and spot the difference

and i can't find many ways of telling

that it is

except for one very important thing but

i'm not going to tell you all about it

just yet before i do that please do all

the usual things like subscribe to the

channel turn those notifications on and

do like and comment

okay now i will reveal all this is the

new Polestar 2 long range two-wheel

drive which means it still has the

largest battery but this time only one

motor that drives the front wheels so

that means less power and speed than the

dual motor flagship car but more

efficiency range and the interesting bit

less cost in fact this model can cost

under forty thousand pounds making it

the same kind of price as a top level vw

id3

said it was interesting this long range

version adds three thousand pounds to

the price but is still three thousand

pounds cheaper than the four-wheel drive

model but the best bit is that nobody

will ever know that you went for the

more cost-effective version because

well it looks exactly the same but the

question is could the single motor pole

star be the pick of the bunch

so you still get a five-seat hatchback

that runs on pure electric power and i

have to say that i think the Polestart

really stacks up in the looks department

it's not double tape pretty but it is

pretty handsome the two-wheel drive

version gets these 19-inch wheels as

standard and it's got the same slightly

rakish roof line that we've always loved

the led lights front and back as

standard ours are the cool frameless

wing mirrors it's generally a great

looking thing and seems to provoke a

positive reaction from most people

[Music]

and it's the same on the inside this

more affordable version hasn't really

lost any of the things that make us

really like the more expensive one you

get the same large touchscreen here in

the center all the computery bits behind

it run a brilliant google operating

system if like me you aren't the most

tech savvy then we have a full tech

rundown of how it all works right here

with tommy on the youtube channel so do

check that out if you need more info you

also get shortcuts here underneath for

the heating and the sound system so you

don't have to go through loads of

sub-menus whilst you're driving to make

it warmer inside or change the uh the

volume on the radio

you also get a voice control system and

because of that google help it actually

works really well listen to this

hi google how are you today

i'm splendid thank you for asking

why are you splendid what's the secret

to that

okay sometimes when i'm bored i google

pictures of alexa

honestly

google being integrated into this car is

absolutely brilliant it is a bit of a

game changer you got plenty of room both

here and also in the back seats are

really comfy heating is standard up

front and the leather is vegan so no

cows died in the making of it although

some plastic bottles definitely found a

second life

it's got a more traditional feeling in

here than some electric cars but in this

case it's a good thing it feels solid it

feels well made

it's very comforting it's an easy car to

spend time in and everything in here is

simple to get to grips with the one

thing i would say is that it just

doesn't seem that premium to me i think

cars like the q4 e-tron

and even the kia ev6

just have a slightly more luxurious

special feel about them but as ever be

aware of the good old options list if

you want to keep it cheapish or other

cars will start to seem more appealing

there are two options packs plus for

four thousand pounds that includes a

panoramic sunroof better stereo and

heated rear seats and pilot which goes

for things like assisted cruise control

pixel led lights and a 360 degree camera

for three thousand

that's seven thousand pounds in options

if you have a fully loaded car and

that's getting a bit pricey it's also

worth pointing out that the only

standard color is black you're going to

have to pay 900 pounds if you want

anything more interesting than that

900 pounds it's outrageous isn't it

particularly when you consider that if

you want something sparkly on the

equivalent volvo it's only going to set

you back 585 pounds

as far as practicality goes it's good

but not outstanding like i mentioned

there's plenty of space in the back for

normal sized people a nice big hatchback

that makes it useful and with the seats

in place the boot is bigger than say a

vw golf so it's really plenty although

it is a bit shallow and the sloping rear

hatch means you might not be able to

carry tall dogs or square furniture back

from ikea the boot is no bigger than the

four-wheel drive model because there's

no extra motor in the rear of this car i

had hoped there might be a bit of extra

boot space

but still there is a frunk up front

which is always very useful and there's

also a really useful

second compartment here underneath the

boot floor

the good news is that the two-wheel

drive too gets the same charging setup

as its bigger sister so that means up to

150 kilowatt dc rapid charging

plugged into the average home war box

it'll charge from flat to full in about

12 hours and top up from 10 to 80

percent on a big rapid charger and just

over 30 minutes giving about 185 miles

of range now that's pretty good but do

bear in mind the owner of the tesla

model 3 kia ev6 or bmw i4 will be back

on the road good few minutes before you

if you were all connected to one of the

new 350 kilowatt rapid charges as far as

range goes the official test cycle says

that you should get 320 miles but we

think that's probably more like 265 270

in the real world which is still decent

though and a good chunk more than the

dual motor car

now when we first drove the Polestar 2

we were very impressed by the fact it

was both comfortable and pretty good fun

to drive which is a really hard trick to

pull off in an electric car

and the good news is that this two-wheel

drive version is very nearly as good

look if you're going to floor it out of

a wet junction you do notice that it

only pulls with the front wheels because

they scrabble slightly but you get used

to that and come on let's face it how

many of us really floor it out to

junctions now even without the extra

motor it still weighs over two tons so

it's not exactly a ballerina but

generally i really like the balance it

strikes between being really comfortable

and not too roly-poly and soft when you

have to go around a roundabout or a bend

and the thing is if i'm entirely honest

i'm not sure i actually miss the extra

power for 95 of the time i don't tend to

accelerate hard enough to make me wish

my neck had extra muscles and this has

got plenty of speed to make it feel both

safe and fun and the ride is firm i like

it might be a bit too jarring for some

and you probably wouldn't want the

optional 20-inch wheels as that would

make it a bit too hard although they do

look lovely and yes there are lots of

modes right here on the brilliant google

interface you can uh turn off the

regenerative braking

um i like to leave it in the standard

one and then stick as much charge as i

can into it and then just turn it off

when i'm on the motorway

and other than that there's just um you

can adapt the steering wheel so you've

got light standard firm just give

a bit more feedback from the steering

and also there it's a sport mode if you

do want to go all out and have fun again

because it's just there in that

brilliant touch screen it's really

intuitive or really easy to find right

at your fingertips one thing i am really

aware of though as i'm driving along is

that the cabin feels

i guess slightly compressed is the word

i'm looking for a bit squashed

um you know visibility is fine but you

do just have a feeling that everything

is slightly enclosed due to the headroom

um i'm only five foot four it's fine for

me but um i'm not sure how it's going to

work if you are well over six foot in

here

i don't know

not sure about that one

[Music]

know what even in this slightly cheaper

slightly more sedate version the pole

star 2 is still a real contender look it

might not be as striking as a kia eb6 or

the new hyundai ioniq 5 and it's

definitely not as fast as a tesla model

3 but it has a kind of reserved under

the radar charm that makes it well worth

considering

the tech alone is absolutely brilliant

it just works really well which is by no

means a given these days sadly it's also

competitively priced for the performance

and range as long as you stay away from

the expensive options

which means and i'm going to say this

quietly i think i might have this one

over the dual motor because you know

what i'd rather save a bit of money and

have the extra range over more speed

who knew

oh god i think i'm getting old

as ever if you'd like to know more about

the Polestar or its competitors like

the ioniq 5 ev6 or model 3 then the
