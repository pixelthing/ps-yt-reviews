thomas with autographer and the new

Polestar 2 front wheel drive version

this one here has just the electric

motor on the front axle this you know

you can say the entry-level version

which then can price-wise also keep up

with the tesla model 3 in the standard

range version very interesting all deals

today and indeed we have a low spec car

for you today here the normal led lamps

which already has the fourth hammer

signature here option you can also get

the pixel led when you go for optional

packages and so on 19-inch wheels we

have here optional that would also be

20-inch wheels and this one also does

not have the performance pack so we have

the standard suspension today looking

forward if this one will bring the same

comfort as for the batteries you either

now also have a small battery 64

kilowatt hours net or then option of the

bigger battery 78 kilowatt hours net in

some markets only the big battery is

being offered and i think

the version to go for will be the one we

have here

big battery but then just the front

wheel drive that is the best price

performance and why the bigger battery

is just an extra price of about 3 000

euros or something and then of course

you want to have that extra 100

kilometers or 60 miles of range

otherwise it will just not be enough

here with the big battery around four

kilometers or 250 miles of effective

range charging here is 11 kilowatt ac or

150 kilowatt dc but the effective

charging curve has shown that the Polestar

2 is not the fastest vehicle in charging

overall by the way in the length here 4

meter 60 or 181 inches that means we are

here in this midsize segment and indeed

the tesla model 3 would be one of the

main competitors we also have a direct

comparison tesla model 3 versus Polestar 2

with the overdrive models each here by

the way the front row dive model only

has an acceleration figure of about 7.4

seconds and interesting is the overdrive

model

it's kind of around

4.7 seconds that's actually easy to

remember of course a big difference but

this one here already looks quite cool

here also with this signature here in

the rear light signature in the rear

that always looks very spectacular very

modern and one of the big advantages is

that the Polestar 2 has this fastback

hatch 400 liters up to 1100 liters here

a meter or 40 inches in width that

actually works

in the front here towards you know that

area it gets a little bit closer but

overall still okay and the length here

you can see

is

about 95 centimeters or 37 inches you

can see also with luggage works very

well and underneath

and underneath

i just have to put

out first there we go

lots a lot of space even here for

example awesome for charging cables you

can also fold the seats right here one

third two thirds split or also with a

ski hedge in the middle turning

indicators in the front looks quite cool

doesn't it

and this is how it looks like in the

rear

this is the car key yeah a little bit

plastic cashy indeed then doctoring

sound

it's quite okay not too good actually

then instead of the doors

nice materials here is also quite soft

so even softer here

it could be a little bit softer for the

elbow i think but it looks really cool

also here with the bright fabric insert

also reasonable space at the inside and

door pockets and then steering wheel is

also from animal free material but also

high grade indeed and then as for the

seeds these are the new base seeds they

are from fabric and either come in this

way all the way black and structured in

the top part

or you can also get the top part here in

the bright siding that would be the

other color option so this is then the

base and optional in the plus package

you can also get high grade leather red

seats either in the black tone or more

in a gray bluish tone we had these ones

earlier

either way the seat form is really

comfortable and good you'll find a good

seating position indeed the fabric seats

the bases here have the advantage

they're a little bit more breathable so

they stay cooler in summertime

the other ones the high grade leather

red seats

weave tech they call it

also all completely animal free and you

can for example wipe them cleaner a

little bit easier this then again

combined with the plus package this one

here being the base version also does

not have panoramic roof

still have a lot of headroom left here

and when you have the panoramic roof

it's also once again

all in the plus package for example also

inductive charging pad so this isn't all

combined you don't have to go for that

it's you know really a matter of price

performance then up and down in out from

the steering wheel

so

indeed nice scene position in the front

a little bit cramped here you can also

see it soon in the other perspective

from the from the rear but overall very

good impression here as for the first

cockpit view in general we see a high

build quality however here this piece i

think they missed out on something

interior overview it's a nice and clean

setup here soft touch here then there's

a new insert that is now available it

has kind of three three dimensional

style that's beautiful and also a fabric

insert right here 11 inch screen so more

deals to that and on the left side 12.3

inch digital instruments also more deals

with that you can see here the steering

wheel on the left side you have cruise

control settings on the right side you

do control then something in digital

instruments or start the

google assistant and i will not say hey

famous search engine i will just press

this button that your smartphone does

not go off and so on one floor you can

see here is a very high middle console

and then between the steering wheel and

this high metal console there's not much

much space here when you have very long

legs so then you feel a little bit

cramped in here steam wheel can be

in out up and down like this very smooth

indeed and that way we have a better

view to the digital instruments and here

we are with the digital instrument this

is kind of like the startup view you

also see that this goes around four

kilometers or 250 miles with a big

battery when you would have a small

battery it would be more like 300

kilometers or 190 miles and when you put

in the gear then you switch here to the

other view yes we are not bringing

seatbelts at the moment for example also

the map view this is a very helpful

thing you have the map all over the

screen in this 12.3 inch instruments and

left side and lower part is sweet then

very good overview what about this

11-inch android-based infotainment

system this is here the main app view

most important apple with the google

maps of course we have you know not the

best

web connection at the moment therefore

it's also not that responsive so it

really also depends on how your web

connection is at the moment interesting

is in root guidance for example when i

want to go to berlin i already typed it

in earlier

then you have two options either you can

directly start it and then the car goes

on that route until it basically is

empty

or then suggests a charging station you

know just before it's empty or you can

add the charging station manually

however if you're already here click add

charging stop then this intelligent

system plays a role and then you can see

that it's always suggesting here and

here and then also a charting stop just

you know

um just before so oh now i click the

the one in between so

i recommend putting this at the charging

stop option before and then you have an

intelligent route set other than that

you have you know here your user account

where you can log in or log out you have

the camera system

we put in the gear then we have it

available here camera system

and there we go

so this and the rear view camera

and

here this is the the car menu you can

change the one pedal driving off

some recoveration or the standard one is

like a very strong recreation with one

pedal driving we would rather recommend

that but lift the

foot gently when you have passengers on

board creeping that's when you lift the

brake if the car rolls forward or not

and then you can also change the

steering wheel if it's more you know

light or standard or firm then you have

more resistance in the steering wheel

actually and you can activate or

deactivate assistance systems and you

can also set a charging maximum it will

be somewhat better for the battery to

have you know like a 90 or 80 or 90

percent limit but then again at some

point you maybe want to charge as much

as possible when you face a longer route

in the front there's no inductive

charging pad in this base version there

would be one if you have the plus

package then you already here have these

two usbc chargers for your phone

like this then there's one button left

this is for the volume and glad to have

that in need because temperature wise

you always have to go here but it's

actually fairly easy to do while driving

for a touchscreen solution this would be

another solution here you can by the way

switch then you know this

left and right two zone ac or use the

voice control

set temperature to 20 degrees

maybe it was too fast set temperature to

20 degrees

[Laughter]

okay one more time i really was too fast

now

set temperature to 20 degrees

okay changing the temperature to 20

degrees

okay that worked i was just too fast

before then here there's also this you

know three-dimensional inlet the

shifting lever is quite interesting

because you have here the Polestar logo

illuminated in the middle that's really

beautiful

and then you have a couple here or a

second one below or what about hey

famous search engine i click the button

now

tell me a joke

what do you call a bear with no teeth

a gummy bear

oh awesome

on our test rule today some 22 kilowatt

hours more kilometers so 35 kilowatt

hours on 100 miles

this would mean

less than four kilometers or 250 miles

but today it was also quite cold then

this car does not have the heat pump so

the optional heat pump also included in

the plus package would also better this

resultant for the winter times but this

was also including a hard acceleration

actually in the rear seating area you

can see here in the base version also

with the fabric seats there is a

substantial middle tunnel that's a

little bit the downside of this one so

doesn't really use the ev platform as

for this respect however what about the

legroom when i have the seat as i would

be sitting right there

it works it's not plenty of space but it

works for fall for adults headroom wise

gets quite close so when i really put my

spine up i do hit

the ceiling i think when i remember

correctly that this was a little better

with the panoramic roof because it's a

fixed panoramic roof that leaves you a

little bit more space indeed yeah in the

middle part then due to this middle

tunnel you have to reach over here but

since it's also a soft fabric you can

also sit in the middle part but once

again the headroom is indeed the problem

right here

yeah we should compare you know like a

have a video piece of the one with the

um with the panoramic roof

pretty sure that's better in that case

then in the lower part we have a usb c

chargers too

there we go and then isofix at the

outside of the seats each the fabric

itself really feels nice once again and

here

also some cupholders with some adaptive

holding functions

[Applause]

let's go

yeah that's what i wanted to test

and you maybe heard that a little bit so

we have wet surface here and front wheel

drive only now you remember that most of

the new electric vehicles they are rear

wheel driven and then optional overdrive

and this one here when you go for the

single motor it is front wheel drive and

indeed when the road is red and you

hammer the throttle then you also maybe

heard that on camera

you do have some wheel spin there in the

front

however you know this also has this

stability control system and

you've seen it also maybe at the

steering wheel

it was not that we were like out of

control or something or that the car was

guiding in the wrong direction so

although there was some wheels in the

front

the car was really calm and collected

and we didn't have you know

too many interferences or something with

with the steering so that's an overall a

good result

now let's drive a little bit faster

and the acceleration is really good you

know of course the overdrive model has

definitely more punch remember the

acceleration figure differences were

7.4

versus 4.7 so you could just turn them

around

but for most situations the acceleration

here of the signal motor will actually

be

enough

of course an electric vehicle with a

rear wheel drive will have more agile

coming out of the corners

so if you're planning for some agile

countryside driving also the river

driven platforms will have an advantage

in comparison to this one here then

indeed

this here will also be a lit will be a

little bit more efficient however it

won't make the biggest difference so the

range will more or less be the same it

more depends on how you really hammer

the throttle by the way talked about

these different recreation modes so when

you have this standard

recuperation you lift the throttle and

then that's really strong recuperation

in the one pedal drive low mode you lift

the throttle

there is notable recuperation

but not that strong that would not be

one pedal driving and off the car is

just rolling and then you use the

regenerative braking with hitting the

brake pedal most of the time i do

recommend the standard mode

because then in situations where you

want to reduce speed you go off the

throttle and before you can even hit the

brake pedal the car is already

decelerating just pay attention that

especially when you have passengers on

board that you control it a little bit

more that you don't have too much

g-forces on the passenger that you like

lift throttle hammer it lift hammer

these electric vehicles they have

instant torque when you hit the throttle

and they also have this strong rig

operation so it's definitely better to

be a little bit more gentle with the

throttle in both ways

noise insulation so far is also quite

good you know at 80 kilometers an hour

so like 50 miles an hour and we don't

have too much noise from the exterior

it's overall a good quality feeling

the steering feel by the way is

precise and direct

not the most

natural one though

however you can also change the searing

feeling here and usually i set it too

firm

because then i have most feedback when

you have the steam feel to light

it is neat very light so i think in this

case firm is actually way to go

turning indicators by the way

have a very unique sound and indeed i

think it sounds quite sophisticated

sometimes there are some vehicles where

you have the indicators and whoa what's

that do i really have to listen for that

for the rest of my car life cycle but

here it's actually unique it's different

but sounds indeed quite good

now when we get it on the motorway

do we still have some punch left when we

just have to sing a motor so you might

be thinking well yeah can i really save

the money and go for a lower spec

version

we'll find out right now so we're at 80

kilometers now up

and let's see we accelerate out just a

little bit

going to left lane first

over is actually quite decent

so

next lane

yeah there are many lanes in here today

so i go to the leftist lane

and now some 60 kilometers an hour to

let's

go that's 100

and 120.

you see this is actually still

reasonable so

even if you're already at speed

there's plenty

of that available so power wise of

course the overdrive is more fun more

spontaneous

but also if you think about um that

wasn't for us

also if you think about

you know how much power are you really

using and once again

for your passengers front and the rear

the lower spec version will be better to

drive better to

experience because there are not so many

g-forces put on your body top speed here

in this one by the way is limited to 160

kilometers an hour or 100 miles per hour

not the fastest of course for german

autobahn

you might want to have something faster

at some point but that's probably just a

german thing the overdrive version would

have than 205 kilometers an hour or 130

miles an hour top speed that would be

then the difference but i think

again for most cases and for most

countries this one will just again be

enough

it would have been cooler maybe a little

bit if this would be rear-wheel drive

but then again this is the platform that

they use the front drive

from motor only then in this case

so i think really from driving it it

doesn't behave that different

i think for the best price performance

indeed pick the single motor version

here

but stick with the big battery otherwise

range will be rather at 300 kilometers

or 190 miles

from

yeah i mean for daily

city cases this is still enough you know

so if city driving is your profile then

you can always go also for the smaller

battery if available in your market

other than that i think the most clever

choice will be big battery and then the

single motor if you go for the plus

package here on the interior

that really depends

the fabric seats are actually quite cool

but if you want some more you know

sophisticated features like the

inductive charging plate or the

panoramic roof or something

and then the the red seats are also

really nice as

the weave tech seats so then you would

need the plus package you can easily go

for that

what you should not go for is the

performance pack today we have the base

suspension and the 19-inch wheels

this ride is so much better than with

performance pack stiffer dampers and the

20-inch wheels so always pick the

19-inch wheels the base weird size the

20-inch look cooler of course yes

but this one here now is decently

comfortable so before i always had the

performance pack and 20-inch wheels and

i was thinking like

whoa this is a very rough ride you know

sporty cool fun but the ride was just

too rough here today now very satisfied

19-inch base suspension so smooth as for

suspension feeds very good good

compromise of sportiness and comfort

because it's still sporty enough it

doesn't lean too much to the left or

right even if you go in a slight slant

or something so this here today is a

good setup

so i think buying the Polestar 2 i would

exactly buy it as it is here today

and then maybe think about

the plus package if you want the leather

red seats and the panoramic roof that's

an of course up to you and of course you

know the um more sophisticated driving

assistant features

this is an also

a piece of that here we only have the

normal cruise control that would be

another reason to go for the plus

package but then if you go for the

bigger battery and the plus package you

still can land up about 50 000 euros or

dollars and that's then a very

competitive package indeed tune into our

tesla model 3 versus Polestar 2 review

from the overdrive models each that's

very interesting to see of course and

also the ioniq 5. it's very interesting

compared to this one
