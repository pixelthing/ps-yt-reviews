welcome back i'm tedward and today

thanks to Polestar boston we're driving

the brand new Polestar 2

this is the all-electric all-wheel drive

dual motor 408 horsepower 476 pound-feet

of torque ev option from sweden pulse

star has completely separated from volvo

so although it looks and feels a lot

like a volvo it is technically not a

volvo but this is a great option if

you're not into the tesla if you're not

into the mustang mock e and maybe if you

can't quite stretch the budget for the

porsche or the audi evs because those

can get really expensive really quickly

this one being a dual motor with the

plus pilot in performance packages comes

in at just under 65 000 i'm pretty sure

a federal tax credit is is needed to get

to that price level but to be frank

that's pretty impressive that you're

getting this much car for that little

money and we're going to talk about the

driving experience but first let's take

a look around it we've got this

incredible metallic paint i really dig

this and that might be because i'm

biased my civic si actually looks very

similar to this and style wise i gotta

say it's reminiscent to me of those

subaru legacies that used to be like

super jacked up i'm not totally sure

what the package is the subaru nerds can

let me know but i always thought those

were fun

and down here we've got 20-inch wheels

but because we have this performance

package we've got the four-pot brembos

in the glorious gold paint i always dig

the Polestar livery and styling and

that's carried out inside as well

because when we open the doors we're

greeted with these great sort of

yellowish gold seat belts and that adds

a lot to the cabin because this one is

fairly simple there's no leather and i

think they call this like a vegan

interior because essentially there's no

animal products involved to some people

that's very important to some people you

might make fun of that but frankly i

like that there's options that fit

people's lifestyles because if that's

the way you want to live you might as

well be able to drive that way too this

roof is all glass so there's no sunroof

to speak of so you're not going to be

open to the elements and there's

actually not even a sun shade but

they're tinted just enough so that way

it's not intrusive in the cabin and

style-wise i'm kind of digging these

sharp lines there's some corners in this

car that i'm just not really seeing in

the design language of anybody else so

i'm having a good time just looking

around it in the back it's very simple

although because we have options we do

have heated rear seats that's lovely

fairly upright seating position in tons

of headroom you could certainly fit a

fairly tall adult back here but that's

all right i think you'd be all right

even if you're about six feet tall

pretty simple arm rest nothing

outrageous but all the touch points

things that you're going to interact

with

are fairly pleasant to deal with and up

front it's a very ergonomic cabin as you

would imagine Polestar being fairly

minimal and you've got your touch screen

up front which we're going to get to

when we're driving and i'll show you all

the things you can do there but it's

certainly not going to overwhelm you

with technology and i think that might

be the point the car is a car it's not a

video game

back here we can do our little kick and

open our trunk

loads of space from this hatch i love a

hatchback and we have a couple

configurations here we do have a cargo

net over here but you can also pop this

up to prevent things from flying around

and you've got these little clips so you

can hang your groceries and then snap

them in place with this little guy i

appreciate that and then underneath

more cavernous space this is the beauty

of not needing a fuel tank you know i'm

sure we've got batteries underneath but

you can put kind of interesting

storage options in these electric

vehicles

now one thing that is fairly

disappointing about it is that there's

not a ton of space in the frunk i think

this is something that

tesla is just absolutely killing when it

comes to what they have offered but up

front

a small amount of storage space look

i've seen worse but you know it would be

nice but you do have your little tire

inflator kit if you were to be so

unlucky let's hope that's not us today

and a jack so despite not having a spare

tire there is still a jack which i

appreciate the sentiment because

sometimes you're able to get a wheel on

the car but you know maybe someone

brought it for you and they didn't have

a jack well you've got one but i do wish

this real estate was used a little

better but you know what i don't know

what's going on up front for cooling

to charge we've got our little charge

port here you're going to be tethered to

chargepoint for the most part because

obviously you're not going to be using

tesla chargers in your polestar closing

the door even feels special because

you've got this little handle here

and then we can strap ourselves in with

our gorgeous gold seatbelts

and before we really take off there's

not a ton of options to adjust on here

but you can adjust your steering feel to

be light standard or firm you can have

your one pedal driving off low or

standard the standard will bring you to

a complete stop if you have the creep

off and you can turn that on obviously

creep is i let off the brake and the car

will start to creep forward or if i turn

it off it will just wait for me to add

throttle i should probably use the

wireless charging here and this has all

google stuff when it comes to maps it's

an android based system

that can be intimidating i am not an

android user i am an iphone user but i

gotta say having google maps on this is

really nice because i like a google map

when we get in the car is essentially

waiting for me i don't have to touch

anything all i have to do is put my foot

on the brake

and put it in drive now you'll notice

we've got about 220 miles of range with

90 battery this is gonna do about

250 miles on a charge and you can decide

whether that's going to give you anxiety

or not i think that's just about the

point where i am okay

anything less than that i feel a little

uneasy but if you get the rear wheel

drive version of this

you end up with a little more about 270.

the performance package also comes with

these olin's adjustable suspension which

you can bring to Polestar and they will

adjust for you for free at any time so

let's see what it does off the line to

60. we're gonna put it

in sport mode

and we're just going to leave everything

else ready we're just going to mount it

that's quick enough and that's the thing

about evs is that everyone is power

crazy it's amazing because you've got

this instant torque where it just jumps

to life so quickly and that is such a

joy when you get into an electric

vehicle that's the charm that's the

character and of course i love an

internal combustion engine i can't

believe i have to qualify that but i

feel like any time i talk highly of some

of the features you can get in an

electric vehicle you just feel excited

it's fun to be able to put your foot on

the pedal and just have that power band

available instantaneously

it's amazing how quick this thing just

kind of gets out of the hole but it's

not violent it's not scary it's

something that you can certainly give

your kids the keys

probably not worry about them dying in

it

loads of grip

even with the steering on light

i feel like i have great tactility and i

kind of know what's going on when we get

into a little bit of a faster corner

where we can see we get these tires to

squeal a little bit on us we'll get a

better vibe for it but here's the thing

i didn't touch the brakes once i'm on

one pedal driving right now i i can come

to a complete stop

like this that's incredible in the city

and it's quite convenient for

consumables because

not only can i recharge my batteries on

this regen i don't have to use any brake

pads doing it

this is a fairly bumpy road and i've

noticed that this olin suspension

is somewhat stiff

not in an unpleasant way but in kind of

a sporty way maybe sportier than this

car

appears

it's kind of an interesting dynamic in

this thing

but i gotta say like i'm pretty

impressed by the way this thing responds

and it's hiding its weight really well

like in a corner i don't feel like i'm

just lugging this massive thing around

the bend i actually feel like

we're working together it's kind of an

interesting thing and i like the way it

puts the power down it feels so balanced

really impressed just by

the body control this has it's like

fascinating that it can do this

this is not the vibe i was anticipating

when i got into this car i genuinely was

expecting it to be a little more boring

and

it it it's a bit of a wolf in sheep's

clothing it has some tricks up its

sleeves that i did not expect

this is hysterically fun

and the beauty is there's no stigma

associated with it because no one's

looking at you like oh that's that

weenie in the Polestar no they say that

about the porsche the audi the tesla

they're not going to say that about this

thing

and it's kind of fun to pin this into a

corner i'm having a good time

all right let's mellow it down let's do

a little normal driving like like

sophisticated people because that's

who's going to buy this if you walk into

the polestar showroom the first thing

you're gonna notice is just how

elegantly minimal it is and that is the

vibe they're selling this is definitely

for this is like an architect's car but

you know if you're just looking for

something simple and robust i i i feel

like this is the vibe you're not looking

for that video game spaceship you're

just looking for something that fits

into your lifestyle and this has just

enough room it has all the things you

need and you know it looks really sleek

i dig these seats now there is one thing

i they do like have these side

bolsters

they could be a little better i feel

like mid-corner i'm falling out of the

seat just a little bit but then again i

don't know that the driver of a polestar

2 is really pinning this thing in a

corner like i'm gonna do and this

blinker noise

not my favorite

hearing this

it's kind of like dropping a piece of

metal on a glass table or something

there's something really sharp about it

which i suppose is good because you'll

never leave your blinker on because

you'll want to turn it off but hopefully

it doesn't mean that you won't want to

use it in the first place i feel like

volvo drivers can usually be trusted to

use their blinkers so i'm not i'm not so

concerned and i'm sorry i know volvo and

polstar are different companies but look

we've been conditioned okay we've been

conditioned and it looks like a volvo

i'm really into these mirrors they

basically have like no dead space it's

all glass like that entire thing is a

mirror it gives me a lot of real estate

i can see what i need to see it seems

pretty simple to do that but you know i

there's not a whole lot of people doing

stuff like that hey off the yellow line

dude you're not going fast enough to

warrant that kind of line anyway uh same

goes for the rear view mirror here and

i've got reasonable rearward visibility

uh even though that you know there's a

heck of an angle on that rear glass i

can still see what's going out there so

that's nice

what's nice too is i don't have a

million options going on here you know

i've got my driver assist modes and

things like that and that's great

normal stuff lane keeping driver alert

collision avoidance etc that's all great

and you know i can see my charge i can

set how much i want it to charge if i'm

trying to conserve this battery i only

want it to go to say 90 or 95 etc um

and at the end of the day we've got our

little car status i can tell that i

don't have any flat tires good so far

and

you know

i can put in on on on the map what i

need through google maps it's a very

familiar interface which i like because

guess what i use google maps

when i check anything on my laptop if

i'm looking where i'm gonna go

that's not how it works with your tesla

or you know pretty much anything else so

i'm definitely into that

road noise it's fairly quiet i mean

obviously there's no internal combustion

engine to interrupt my train of thought

or freak me out with a with a a stilted

idol

caution amphibians crossing

okay we will keep our eye out for

amphibians

you know you're going to get some wind

noise you're going to get some tire

noise and i think it's really important

when you have an ev that you get a quiet

tire that's going to do the job because

that tire noise can be invasive i i have

a brand new 2022 honda civic si on all

seasons they are

ferociously loud and it's a fairly quiet

drivetrain powertrain so that's all you

hear on your ev

same goes for that you know you're

really going to be noticing that tire

noise

i like the seating position too i feel

like i'm nice and low i feel like

there's a bit of joy in the drive as

well

and

you know

i just wasn't expecting these kind of

dynamics

let's go get it out to the highway do

kind of a normal commute feel because

that's the other thing about evs they

are very efficient at very low speeds

right if you're a city driver this is

going to do you a world of good just for

your energy consumption if you just kind

of live in stop and go traffic

if you're someone who's traveling long

distances and you like to go 80 85

that's where these kind of start to fall

off they're still going to be plenty

efficient but you're not going to get

the kind of range that you would if you

were going slower once you start to push

air that's where evs kind of

they don't do the thing

ah let's go catch a little weird ev

larry david in his bmw i3

all right 70 miles an hour that kind of

seems to be where it's happy we go a

little faster than that it definitely

feels like i'm adding a bit of throttle

or i'm needing more throttle than i

should and that like that's fine i'm

just saying that's probably that cut off

where like 70 to 75 is where it's in its

most happy place

and it does have some trick features of

course it has adapted cruise control but

it also has

the pilot assist so that means it's

gonna like maintain my lane do the thing

now most cars do this but not all cars

do this well for example i've got a

honda that does this it ping-pongs

around a little bit it doesn't do a

great job see it's asking me to hold the

steering wheel i can do that i will help

you out but this is doing a pretty good

job something it won't do that your

tesla might do

it will not change lane upon request

okay it's not going to change that lane

just because you put the blinker on so

that means that

when i put my directional on it's going

to cancel that pilot assist

that's going to go off

and then i change my lane myself

it comes back and we're good to go

it seems very smooth everything seems

happy it doesn't get confused this is a

good pilot assist you're not getting

some crazy like autonomous driving from

it but you are getting a solid system

that is going to take some of the stress

out of driving which is really the point

and it's gonna bark at me for not

holding the wheel enough i'll do my best

okay little Polestar thank you for your

concern

there's something really cool

about

silently accelerating

to 80 miles an hour on an on-ramp and no

one's the wiser you know you don't have

to make a big stink about it we're just

getting to speed we're doing what we

need to do

destroying our range likely on the way

but that's okay

today is about fun today is about

experience

so as a buyer of an ev you're going to

want to go through all the stops you're

going to want to know about efficiency

you're going to want to know about

charge time you're going to want to know

about range how to find your chargers

how is it going to fit into your

lifestyle and these are things that i

can't answer for you but today what i

can answer for you is that the driving

experience of this Polestar 2 is

surprisingly good i think that this

doesn't feel like a video game it

definitely feels like a car i'm

genuinely impressed with the chassis and

especially

the olin suspension so maybe a good idea

to get that performance package and

frankly

i love the minimal design and i think

this has like no stigma attached to it

like maybe a tesla or a porsche might

have there's no showboating you just

kind of look like a cool classy dude and

while it's quick enough in a straight

line you're not gonna be that guy who

has to go give thrill rides all the time

at work you know oh take us to lunch we

want to know how fast your tesla is guys

it gets old it gets old especially if

you're driving a plaid you're going to

want to puke every time you do it and

your friends are going to want more not

fun so this is definitely fast enough it

has the chops and i think this would fit

into your lifestyle just fine if this is

the range and charging network that you

are willing to be a part of so thank you

so much to polestar boston for calling

me up and giving me the opportunity to

drive this car i'm genuinely surprised i

i like it a lot i would love to spend

some time with this car so if pollstar

if postar wants to give me like a

long-term Polestar 2 i would be more than

happy to oblige and uh and put some

serious miles on this thing i i dig i

like it it's fun so thank you so much

for watching liking commenting and

subscribing i'm gonna go drive in some

traffic which is like oddly not

stressful at all because ev and

yeah don't forget to respect the drive

and i'll see you in the next one

[Music]

kind of shocked by the grip this has

like this is genuinely impressing me in

a way that i was not anticipating
