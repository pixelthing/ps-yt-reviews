at launch the Polestar 2 was quick fun

to drive solidly built and had less

range than offerings from other

automakers so what's a few dozen miles

here and there well for the range

obsessed that's probably enough to push

somebody to another automaker well

pulstar wasn't finished in fact it had

something else it had this

this is the Polestar 2

single motor long range edition of its

car it starts at 45

900 and it has an epa estimated range of

270 miles that should be more than

enough to get you anywhere you need to

be but adding all those miles well there

is a trade-off instead of an all-wheel

drive vehicle this polstar r2 is

front-wheel drive so you lose some of

the traction especially at takeoff

there's also a power loss by going from

two motors to one the single motor

vehicle has 231 horsepower instead of

408 found in the all-wheel drive version

and that translates to a 0-60 time

that's 2.5 seconds slower at 7 seconds

acceleration is still plenty quick

especially when you're on the freeway

and you need a little extra boost in

order to pass somebody

that said when you're driving this

vehicle and you're going from a

standstill there is a slight delay that

i didn't notice on the dual motor

version of the pulse star 2. Polestar 2 of

course two motors a bit quicker this

Polestarted with a single motor not as

quick but most people actually don't

need to be driving that fast so a single

motor pull star like this one with the

front wheel drive it's plenty for most

people

this version of the Polestar 2 because

it is front-wheel drive you will

encounter some understeer when you're

really pushing it around corners and

that's true of any front-wheel drive

vehicle you're gonna get under steer

under steer is what happens when you're

going really fast and you turn the wheel

and the car keeps going straight that's

under steer over steers when you're

going really fast and you turn the wheel

and the back of the car flies out that

is over steer you're going to get

understeer in this vehicle you're going

to get understeered every front-wheel

drive vehicle and in this one it's only

when you're really pushing it and most

people won't be doing that

pulstar offers up three different

steering modes firm standard and light

i typically stick to the sportiest

steering feeling even when cruising

through parking lots it gives the

vehicle a more dynamic feeling when it

comes to braking the brakes on this

vehicle are great but more importantly

Polestar and volvo have the best

regenerative braking one pedal driving

system of any other vehicle on the

market their system is

to me the best it's the easiest to

master it only takes a few stops at a

few stop signs to really sort of figure

it out you just lift your foot off the

accelerator and you come to a stop

exactly where you want to again this is

only after a few tries for example i

have to stop right here

and

boom perfect

that of course brings us to range the

feature that benefits from that single

motor from those slower 0 to 60 times

and the robust regenerative braking

system the epa states that this Polestar 2

will do 270 miles on a single charge and

that's outstanding except that i got

something better on a range test where i

drove the vehicle on the highway at 70

miles an hour and on back roads and on

suburban streets

i got a range of

278 miles which is well eight miles more

than what the epa is offering up so

that's a good thing

the Polestar 2 has a battery pack capacity

of 78 kilowatt hours of that 75 kilowatt

hours is available for use based on our

test that means the efficiency of the

Polestar 2 is 3.7 miles per kilowatt

hour pretty good for a vehicle from

volvo's performance division in order to

replenish all those electrons the Polestar

2 supports dc fast charging up to 150

kilowatts now that's pretty good but it

is still bested by vehicles made in

korea and by tesla the hyundai ioniq 5

and the kia ev6 both support charging up

to 350 kilowatts while the tesla model 3

and model y boast apart charging up to

250 kilowatts that said charging at home

is likely how this vehicle will stay

ready to go if you completely deplete

the battery a level 2 station at up to

11 kilowatts will get you back to full

in about eight hours and while you're

out in the world you become accustomed

to

android automotive

both volvo and polestar have embraced

google's infotainment system and i threw

on my account i pl plug in my spotify

account as you can tell i listen to the

office ladies and these are the apps

that i have available right now the

biggest benefit is maps because it is

linked to my google account anything

that i search for on my phone will show

up here and i also have access to

charging stations in the area and of

course my usual destinations my home and

work carplay was announced when this

vehicle was unveiled but

we still don't have car play i have

reached out to polstar and they have

assured me that car play is coming to

the vehicle in the future but in the

meantime android auto does offer a

streamlined interface with one of the

best voiced assistants on the market

that can be used to navigate launch

media set the temperature and even

answer random questions

the world's tallest mountains include

mount everest at

8848.86 meters k at 8 611 meters and 8

others

see we had to cut google out of that

edit so that your home devices wouldn't

go crazy telling you the tallest

mountains android automotive also

includes access to the play store not

the entire google play store instead

a curated set of apps built specifically

for vehicles including a browser which

is a nice way to pass the time while

charging

most of the apps available right now are

streaming based including one

for bronies

but the amount of apps available has

increased since android automotive

launched and i expect it to get even

larger as more and more auto makers

embrace android automotive the

minimalism of android automotive mirrors

that of the vehicle's interior like

volvo pulse stars interior doesn't come

with a lot of buttons there is a

physical button for the volume but the

climate controls are part of the

infotainment system throw in a few

buttons on the steering wheel pretty

much hit all the buttons available in

this vehicle everything is where you

expect it to be without much in the way

of frills instead it just feels very

streamlined the rest of the vehicle

really follows the swedish design

aesthetic it's very subdued very

minimalistic but also very stylish it's

also very vegan they have this vegan

weave tech here on the seats

so you don't have to worry about killing

cows while you're also trying to save

the world driving an ev the seats are

actually quite comfortable they're

sturdy they bolster you and the rest of

the materials in the vehicle feel very

upmarket you can add leather to this

vehicle but it does seem a bit garish

to add leather to this vehicle it is a 4

000 option but you just can't add

leather by itself you also have to add

it as hard as the plus pack which is an

additional 4 000

so in order to drape this vehicle with

dead cows it cost eight thousand dollars

so what i'm saying is you better really

like leather the front seat offers

plenty of head and leg room the back

seat though well it offers leg room as

long as the adults sitting up front

aren't too tall plus rear headroom could

be an issue for those taller than six

foot four back here in the trunk you

have a pretty decent sized trunk it's

14.3 cubic feet of space but what's nice

is that you have this little divider

that pops up and you can hang your bags

on here you got this little strap to

keep your stuff down and there's a

little extra space under here it's a

little l-shaped

but the trunk you can probably get about

four to five carry-on

suitcases back there which is great if

you're going on long road trips because

you have 270 miles of range the Polestar 2

long range single motor ev might at

first glance seem like the less fun

version of the Polestar 2 lineup the

reality is most people don't need all

the performance offered up by the

all-wheel drive Polestar 2. instead

they'll get more out of the extra 21

miles of range and the 4 000 they save

either one you choose you'll get a

stylish ev that has one of the best

infotainment systems on the market and

that's essentially because we've been

using google products in our phones and

in our homes for years that said the

Polestar 2 is a great ev that will

eventually get part play support

someday
