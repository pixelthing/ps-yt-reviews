hey everybody inside the Polestar 2

today

friends and some of you viewers have

asked this question

dale do you actually drive your car or

just spend all your time

doing little modifications and tweaks to

it and the answer is

yes i do drive it but we're still in a

lockdown here in the uk so i'll see only

essential trips and there's a fair few

little things and tweaks

that i've wanted to do to this car that

i planted even before it arrived so i'm

just slowly working my way through the

ones

that i can do one whilst we're in

lockdown i don't know if you can see in

here but

it's absolutely lashing it down so

inside the post r2 today

and what we're going to be doing is

wrapping the center console

so right now you get the nice

kind of piano black gloss

covering um but

i don't know if you've ever had piano

black gloss

stuff before it is a magnet for

scratches and tarnishing and stuff like

that so

mine's still in great condition

obviously the car's only just done over

100 miles

but we're going to take this out and

wrap it so i'm going to show you how you

do that how you take it out

how you can wrap it yourself so you have

to pay someone 80 pounds

your only basic stuff your hands

screwdriver to undo a couple of screws

obviously some vinyl covering which you

can get for 10 pounds

a hair dryer ideally um you can do it

cold but it'll work better with a

hairdryer or some form of heat source

and a little squeegee just to help kind

of iron things out so

let's roll the intro and then we'll get

on with the

the job at hand

[Music]

okay so i'm gonna do my best with the

camera angles as i show you how to take

this out

first thing i'm gonna try and help you

decide ahead of time so if you decide to

do this

you don't have to kind of waste your

money on different types of vinyl so

there's a couple of options in my mind

obviously you can do what you want it's

your car

and again this is all for me personal

preference but

i'll take you through my thinking so as

mentioned already

it's a nice gloss black color

it looks really good but i've given it a

little clean but

there's fingerprints that happen all

over this thing and obviously it's going

to scratch

quite easily so you've got a couple of

options option one

obviously is to do nothing option two

you could

wrap it in a clear kind of ppf

protective covering so it would still

look quite similar

but you're gonna have a some level of

protection over it so

that the ppf like you have externally on

a car will perfect

and protect it from scratches and all

that kind of thing option two

is you could get some gloss black

vinyl that you could cover it in so i

just kind of pop that

over the top this is a kind of off cut

that i have

in there the cupboard and so you can see

if you wrapped it in that

it would actually probably pretty look

just like it did

originally i don't know if you can see

on here this is a slightly cheaper bit

and it's been sat around for a while

it's still going to scratch and show up

quite easily so personally

i wouldn't bother just redoing it

in gloss black another option which i

think actually looked really good and i

think it's probably quite popular with

people is to

carbon wrap it so it looks good nice

glossy carbon

um in my past experience i have wrapped

a whole interior of a previous car

in gloss carbon wrap and look really

good so just kind of show you roughly

what that might look like

if we had that done in here and i

actually think it would

it would blend in quite well let me just

try it on the other side as well when

it's better on the camera

i think it actually looked pretty good

but for me the reason why i'm not doing

um the carbon wrap

is i'm not sure what it

kind of blends with i want it's to kind

of

look a bit oem i don't want it to look

like hey i just suddenly decided to

to wrap this so i'm gonna go with

a brushed metal kind of look

and i think it's gonna blend in with

uh you know the wood ash stuff going on

here so i'll show you

the the two colors that i'm considering

so

one is like a silver metaled kind of

brushed metal effect which i will lay

down here

or a black kind of brushed metal effect

so i'll just

position both of those and show you on

the camera what those look like

so we have obviously the the carbon over

here which i won't be going with

the black and then the silver so

i'm going to take a few minutes to have

a little look see if i think that it's

going to

what color is basically going to blend

in best with the surround

the black ash and kind of the weave tech

kind of materials and everything and

then

i'm going to show you how to remove that

center console and then we will wrap it

in one of these and then pop it back in

okay so

i can't quite decide myself where i'm

going for the black

or kind of the dark gray silvery color

i think the black blends in the best

with the kind of wood surround

but the kind of silvery color

is a bit more of a contrast i think the

the piano black is more of a contrast

from the black surround so i need to try

and decide if i want to blend in

or not the reason i decided to include

that bit in this video is

that the beauty of vinyl wrapping is

that you can change your mind

so once you've applied a wrap if you

decide you want to take it off you can

you just want to heat it back up again

so the glue is soft

underneath and then gently pull it back

as you continue to heat it

uh as you get it off no different if you

saw my video on how to remove the

polestar stickers

on the side of the car it's going to be

exactly the same process so

let's show you how to pop this center

console out

then we get onto wrapping and put it

back in and

see if we're happy with the finished

effect

okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna have to show

you this before i do it

and kind of insert some overlay pictures

or something because

i'm only on my own so i haven't got

someone to hold the camera so basically

this whole center console is held in

with some clips

around here so you want to start off at

the top so we're going to get both our

hands in

either side under here

and and pull up we have to pull up with

relative force whilst you want to be

gentle not to break the clips

once the two top clips out it should

gently

kind of come down so i'll make a start

on mine then i'll come back with a video

once when i show you the clips at the

end it will help you

kind of get an idea of what you need to

do to pull these clips off and get the

center console off

it will still have some wires connecting

up to the charging ports

and obviously this socket and things and

so we have to unclip those

but i'll show you that as we go okay so

we're back

so you can see i started off by pulling

up this one side

you can see it's come up here see under

there

and then on the other side so again all

of this

is coming up and out together which will

disconnect

afterwards and now you can see

we can keep moving it along a little bit

and the clips

that are under the end here come up as

well just like that

so don't be alarmed by the large

clacking noises uh then only two hands

but basically

so i don't know scratch the water or

anything ease this whole thing off

up over the drive selector and then

there'll be some cables underneath

where we can disconnect these things

okay so you can see i've gently pulled

this up over the drive selector and then

underneath

we can see that we obviously have some

cables

connected so we're gonna disconnect this

green connector

just here

and this purple one

just here and then we should be able to

get access

and remove this whole console and then

separately

we will just unscrew different modules

but i'll show you that

in the next part of the video okay so

the green connector

which i get to zoom in just has a push

top

you can see here just push down

on that so it's up like this so push

down with the one finger and it will

just pull straight down so it's really

easy to get out

okay so i've realized an easier thing to

do than trying to

remove the power and data cable

over here this little purple pink one is

if we just remove

the charging pad from

this piece of the center console anyway

so you can see just here if i get the

camera to

focus properly there are a retaining

clip on either side

exactly the same on the other side

so if we pop those out then

this center piece will just come away

leaving the charging map

behind so again we'll need two hands

it's probably gonna be a little bit

fiddly you have to apply a little bit of

force

in there to separate these two bits just

here

this is what i'm trying to point at to

kind of pull those up you can see

how they clip in there so i'll just pull

those out and i'll show you what it

looks like when it's off

okay so getting those bits to come out

was actually

it's a pool actually really quite firm

on it and

i was expecting it so i'd probably put

some toweling

or something around the sides and on the

screen so if it does

kind of pop off then it's not going to

be too scary but this

this is it so we have this piece off

for doing the wrapping and then this is

what we are

leaving behind and i'll see then put

everything back

in situ when we finished you can see

already just

you know prints from my palms

just from trying to get this off leaves

the markings so we're gonna go in the

garage

and then we're going to look at doing

the wrap

that's one thing i have done before i

get out the car now i've just pushed

this

back into place obviously this center

console sits

in here so we shouldn't need to have

this out

uh i'll put a little note at the bottom

of the screen now if

that was a bad idea but um obviously

when the center console goes back in

we plug that cable back in to the kind

of volume control knob

and then we've got the one two three

four five six points where

it all kind of fit back together okay so

in the garage now with the center

console taken out i'm just going to give

it a

wipe over with a microfiber cloth no

solution on it or anything we don't want

to

kind of add anything that will impact

the adhesive

so again just give it a nice kind of

clean over with the cloth

i'm going to use my roby cordless heat

gun just because that's

easier for me if you are using a heat

gun

um you just need to be careful you don't

get too close because it will

or you have the option that it might

heat up the wrap

too much and kind of melt and shrink it

so in some ways a hair dryer

is better we may not even need to use

um the heat gun depending on how well

the wrap

is going to go over once we've cleaned

this off

then we just need to get

in here to remove

the control unit at the front there so

i'll just see what we need

and then come back show you how to

remove that

okay so a t20 torx bit so there's four

of those so we're just gonna

undo those four screws

and then separate this unit

from the fascia piece okay so put those

four screws to one side so you're gonna

need those to put them back later

just make sure you don't over tighten

them when they're going off it's in

plastic

and you don't wanna kind of crack or

anything once that's done

this literally just pulls straight out

so we can put that to one side as well

and now it leaves us with just the

center console fascia to get access to

and the reason for doing that is we want

to when we do the wrap we're about to

fold

some of it back in itself just around

here

and around here to get a nice tighter

finish

so i've decided i'm going to go with the

black

brushed steel wrap because

i think it's going to stand out less and

i actually don't want it to be too

contrasting

so i'm going to get some of that

and then get ready to do this

okay so i've cut off some wrap the kind

of size that i need

so you put it up upside down on the rack

you want to have enough

so it's going to cover a bit the bottom

and the top remember this curves a

little bit so you definitely want a bit

of slack at the top

i will cut a little bit more off the

sides because i don't need that much

um but also keep in mind depending on

what pattern you're using

i want my kind of brushed aluminium

steel or whatever it is effect

to run vertically so i have to make sure

that obviously i'm

got this in the right orientation

because i don't want it to go

horizontally so just keep that in mind

i'm going to just trim up

what i need a little bit more so i

haven't got too much overhang

and it will make it a little bit easier

for me to work with and then the other

thing i'm going to quickly do

is obviously the car is cold it's winter

right now here in the uk that i'm doing

this

i'm going to give a little bit of a

blast around here with the heat gun

just to warm things up a little bit make

the stuff a little bit more tacky

and then we can get into it i also have

a little bottle here of just

soapy water so just water with a bit of

soap in there it's a bit fair it could

or whatever you ever handy

so we can spray that on the surface

to help us maneuver things around a

little bit if we need to so

also not worked with this um plastic

before

it's slightly different to what i've

used uh

when i've wrapped previous cars

internally so i'm not sure i'm going to

need this

so just keep that in mind and so watch

this video all the way through

before attempting it okay so now we're

going to get ready with

our squeegee so nice uh padded protected

side here so we don't scratch all the

material

i also like using i don't know what the

official name is i call it a fine

dipper so if i have to get in any

crevices and help kind of pull things

round

on the corner that will help and then

obviously a nice sharp

blade so you can get a nice clean cut

so i'm going to try and position the

camera

at an angle as best i can so you can see

what it is i'm doing and i try and show

you the process

of doing the wrap so as you can see i've

cut it down to size

more now so there's less overhang on the

sides it will taper down a little bit

but that won't be

a problem so uh yeah let's see if we can

wrap this thing

okay so apologies isn't the best angle

i'm

doing my best i don't really have a

tripod or anything available

that i can use at the moment so

just again like i said before wipe it

clear you want to make sure there's no

kind of bits of grit or hair or anything

on

there because basically any like little

perfection

especially if you're using piano black

or something that isn't

texturized it's going to show up really

badly

on here and even just actually cleaning

this with the microfiber cloth don't

know where it's going to show up on the

camera

you know i can see little marks and

stuff that's coming on this so

you know i like to think i'm careful and

kind of probably the ott we're

protecting stuff

but um yeah i think even i would

struggle to keep this

looking nice i don't know why Polestar

decided to do it

anyway so there we go all nice uh and

clean

so put our microfiber cloth to one side

we will need that again

remember check your orientation of where

you are putting things and now we're

going to take the

the back off

and again i don't know yet if we're

gonna need

to be able to move this around a lot

i've not used this particular

um vinyl before it is one of the

kind of 3m air gap ones so there are

kind of little

um slits in the back to allow air to

move around

nicely but again get all this off

and then i'm literally just going to

gently pop this over the top so again

remember

the back leans off a little bit so you

want to make sure you have some overhang

so actually i'm probably going to just

line this up at the bottom

and then pop it down obviously you want

the lines to be straight

i think that's a pretty good starting

position

so from here we're gonna get our

squeegee

and we're just gonna try and just gently

find the edges of here so i'm not sure

it's probably my shot too well let me

just do a little bit more before i

bring it up to the camera so i want to

lose shape

this actually feels quite easy to work

with

some of the carbon wrapper done before

you definitely need

some fluid on the back to help and

maneuver things around a little bit but

this actually feels pretty

good

okay so if i just bring this up to show

on the camera hopefully you start to see

the outlines and that's what we're

basically doing right now we're just

trying to

be nice and gentle we don't need to do

any any hard stuff

let the wrap do most of the work for us

i was just going to be a little bit

careful

over the holes we want to try and keep

that as taut as possible because we're

going to cut those

out a bit later so it's going to be this

back piece that will be a little bit

harder

because we also just need to have the

wrap

kind of come down so i probably have to

lift it up a couple of times and ease it

over

okay and this is where we start to have

a little bit of difficulty because it's

slightly beveled that edge

so this is where i have to use the heat

to help mold things around

okay so i'm pretty happy with everything

up until the top

of this connector now

so i'm going to start to apply a little

bit of heat

to help make that be a bit more

malleable over the top so again if

you've got a heat gun

you can use it again don't get too close

or you can use a hair dryer which

obviously doesn't get quite as hot so

you have a little bit more wiggle room

and as to how close you can get i always

keep a finger

kind of in line with the heat gun or the

hair dryer because if it's too hot for

my

body it's probably gonna be the right

temperature

or you're getting too hot probably for

the uh the vinyl

as you heat things up it obviously will

get more tacky as well

so you're gonna find it be a little bit

stickier

and again this is where we start to have

slightly harder job

sticking it down so you can see here i

do have

some bubbling at the back here that i

have to contend with

because i'll keep working it around

and again the main thing of any vinyl

wrapping is just patience

just be patient with what you're doing

and what i'm actually probably going to

do is grab some scissors

and i'll just cut around

the back so i don't have as much

overhang

to be having to deal with i'm still

going to keep some you want some around

the borders

so again i'm going to probably tuck some

of that around the edges here to kind of

sit in a bit better but i'll just chop

around

give myself around a centimeter

on the sides

[Music]

okay so get my sharp blade

and what i'm going to do

from the vinyled side i'm just going to

kind of cut in

the one and then an angle i'm just going

to

follow the edge round

just like that so it's going to give me

a very small amount of overhang but

enough that i can kind of

tuck over at the end so different people

do this a different way this is just how

i like to do it

again if it all goes wrong you just peel

it back and start again anyway so i'm

just going to go around the whole thing

with my blade just to neaten things up

and i'll come back

before we tackle the middle parts

okay so now we're going to do we're

going to start to heat up

the gaps the holes a little bit so again

i've just trimmed off

around the sides and now we're going to

heat up inside here

and you'll see start to deform itself

i'm going to get too hot with it

we gently push start to form down

and then we can use our squeegee a

little bit

start forming

the lip that's basically what we're

trying to do is gently warm it up

[Applause]

[Music]

okay so once that's cut out then we can

do

is we can start again

use our fingers to gently push this

in and around into the corners don't

push too

too much right now because again it's

going to be cold so we just heat it up

and it will help naturally just find

that line then we can just use our

finger

to follow around

[Music]

okay this is the finished wrapped result

i'll be lying if i said i was a hundred

percent happy with it but at the same

time

you know i can take it off and do it

again if when i put it in the car it

does not look

as good as i'd like it to do the

overhangs are a little bit

squishy on the sides not quite sure how

well they're going to show up

when it's in or not but i think it looks

um pretty decent again didn't cost me 80

pounds to

get wrapped professionally i'm not

saying it's as good as a professional

job

but that kind of shows what the end

result looks like and then well

as i drop it from the other side

so not too bad we're finished putting

things back together

pop it in the car and then see if we're

happy with the

finished result i think i just need to

heat up this side a little bit it's got

a little bit um

scrunched up on the edge it's not

helping really that's freezing cold

in the garage you guys to do this again

i would do it in the house so the the

temperatures are room temperature

it would mean that things don't cool

down quite as quick as they are

right now so basically putting it back

in the cars i'm exactly the same

in reverse we're just gonna ease it over

the top

of the drive selector and push down it

should all clip into the side so

let me finish put things back in and

then see

how it looks in the car okay that's it

it's back in and finished so

i think it looks pretty good in terms of

i'm definitely happy with the color

and the contrast it actually looks

darker

in real life than it's showing up on

this picture this angle works a little

bit better

but yeah i'm happy with it i think i

will

take it out and do it again in the

summer i'm not 100 happy with

some of my finish on the edges here but

i'll see how it holds up

over time but uh yeah i hope this video

helps and

gives you the encouragement

uh knowing that you know it's not really

that hard to take these things apart

just need to be gentle and then take

your time

and doing the wrapping as i mentioned

before if you want to take this up just

heat it all up again

with a hair dryer gently peel it back

and uh yeah you'll be good to go again

so this video was helpful please leave

comments below let me know how you get

on

did you like this color would you have

gone with something else and
