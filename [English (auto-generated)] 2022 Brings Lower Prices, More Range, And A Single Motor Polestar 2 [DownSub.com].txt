[Music]

today i'm out in northern new mexico

with the 2022 Polestar 2. for the 2022

model year polstar has made some pretty

substantial changes to their first

electric vehicle not the least of which

is the price tag there is now a model

that will get you down after tax credits

and incentives to about 35 000 making

this one of the more affordable evs in

the united states and there's also a new

base dual motor version that's the model

i'm taking a look at first although on

the outside honestly the single motor

and the dual motor look identical before

we go on i should address a question

that i get very frequently when talking

about polestar vehicles what's the

relationship between volvo and polestar

well polstar is partially owned by volvo

and partially owned by volvo's parent

company geely yes effectively it's all

owned by Geely but the reason they

structured it in this way is that

because once volvo gets spun off at some

point in the future they would continue

to own about half of Polestar polestar

is an all-electric vehicle brand that

really started inside volvo to be

perfectly honest and that's why the

Polestar 2 looks an awful lot like a

volvo this was the original volvo 40

concept unlike other luxury brands that

i could mention polestar absolutely does

not shy away from their connection with

volvo because it's definitely an asset

for them this vehicle right now is

manufactured in a volvo factory in china

there's also a Polestar factory in

china that is separate from the volvo

factory things get complicated and the

upcoming polestar 3 is actually going to

be built in the united states in south

carolina in a volvo factory so Polestar

has the ability to leverage volvo parts

volvo components volvo supplier

connections which is really important

and of course volvo manufacturing and

service component distribution etc so

it's really an asset for this vehicle

even though polestar is a brand new

electric car brand they've sprung into

existence very rapidly because they can

draw upon expertise and logistics etc

from the volvo portfolio the other

important mission for pulstar is to be a

technology incubator for volvo and other

related companies so these are the

vehicles that will get technologies

first like the pixel led headlights the

google infotainment system the dual

motor electric drive train etc advances

in electric drive trains from the entire

corporation they're going to be

spearheaded by Polestar and then later

they'll be adopted by the other brands

now let's get back to the Polestar 2.

this is just over 181 inches long this

is technically a compact luxury sedan

although it's a little bit more compact

than most of the competition this is

about three to four inches shorter than

options like the tesla model 3 or of

course the bmw 3 series both of which

you could consider direct competition to

the Polestar too and that's because

this is based on the same platform as

the volvo xc40 which was designed to not

only create compact cars like this but

also sub-compact vehicles the other

twist with the Polestar 2 is that it has

a lift back not a trunk so even though

this is shaped a little bit like a sedan

we have a practical lift back

arrangement back here making the format

of this vehicle a little bit more like

the audi a7 i'm actually a little

surprised that polestar chose not to

call this a crossover because it has a

hair more ground clearance than the ford

mustang machi and if you squint this

actually has about the same kind of

profile as the maki and the model y the

trunk lid or what i guess you could call

a trunk lid right back here is pretty

high off the ground that really improves

cargo practicality and it definitely

gives this something of a sedan meets

crossover vibe arrow is really important

with the modern ev but Polestars made some

interesting choices they have these

really slim side view mirrors but we

have regular door handles these are the

pull style door handles they don't go

flush in the vehicle they're not

motorized anything like that these

logically are going to be a little bit

more reliable than the motorized door

handles but there's another good reason

for why polestar decided to do this

they're going to be selling this vehicle

in europe and a lot of colder climates

where this kind of handle is just easier

to open in the ice and the snow an

interesting touch with polestar vehicles

is that badging is kept to a very

discreet minimum we have a Polestar

logo located right here on the front

bumper we then have removable stickers

on the front doors these stickers are

the only way you'll be able to

differentiate externally between the

single motor and the dual motor the dual

motor puts out 300 kilowatts that's the

power output from the electric motors

408 horsepower 300 kilowatts on the

single motor version that same sticker

says 170 kw and at the very back we have

another discrete Polestar logo no other

text on the rear bumper or the rear lid

moving to the rear we have a pretty

distinctive light pipe that runs from

one side to the other amber led turn

signals which are a nice touch some

discrete silver accents at the bottom of

the bumper again those can get blacked

out if you get that option package

parking sensors right down there at the

bottom and the release for this lift

back is right there just above the

license plate now let's dive into the

Polestar 2's drivetrain because it has

been updated for 2022. the dual motor

version receives only a few minor tweaks

mainly having to do with efficiency and

improving range it's still 408

horsepower thanks to a dual identical

motor setup 204 horsepower in the front

204 horsepower in the rear 487

pound-feet of torque combined the

battery is also identical to last year's

it's a 78 kilowatt hour nominal battery

75 kilowatt hours of that is usable it's

a modified skateboard battery so it's a

little bit different than some of the

other evs that we see out there as you'd

expect there are advantages and

disadvantages to the design we still

have a center tunnel here because that

was part of the structure of the floor

pan of the vehicle but they were able to

use it to put batteries in they were

also able to keep the foot wells really

low because no batteries are below the

rear passengers feet or the front

passenger's feet instead everywhere else

in the vehicle has batteries and then

batteries are basically double stacked

right back there behind the rear seats

range is up for 2022 249 miles according

to the epa rating on this particular

vehicle if you get the single motor

version that's going to go up to 265

miles because they put just one motor in

the vehicle and that one motor is going

to live up front on the front axle power

goes up a little bit to 231 horsepower

and 243 pound-feet of torque if you get

that model logically if there was

customer demand there's no particular

reason that polestar couldn't create a

rear-wheel drive Polestar 2 with a single

motor that's entirely possible with this

platform but they chose to put the motor

up front because it's likely a little

bit less expensive than a single motor

in the rear there's a little bit less

cabling going on there are other high

voltage systems going on under the hood

like the heat pump that's optional for

2022 the air conditioning system that is

standard etc the other two logical

reasons have to do with regen braking

ability and vehicle dynamics when regen

braking remember that in any vehicle the

front tires and brakes are doing the

vast majority of the braking and we see

something very similar in dual motor evs

if you get the Polestar 2 with two

electric motors the front electric motor

is doing the majority of the regen

braking the rear is doing some but not

as much as the front motor that's all

because of vehicle dynamics when you're

breaking a vehicle hard the last thing

you want to do is lock up the rear tires

and not have any stability going on back

there especially if you're entering a

corner or if you're on an icy surface

that's something that you will

definitely notice in single motor evs

that are rear-wheel drive with

aggressive throttle lift off regen if

you're in a corner and you lift off you

can get some squirreliness back there

that you don't find in evs where we just

have an electric motor up front and

similarly aggressive regen is going on

because this is naturally dynamically

where the vehicle wants to do the

majority of its braking all things being

equal it's probable although Polestar

won't confirm this that this is capable

of regenerating more electricity because

the motor is up front versus putting

that single electric motor in the rear

and then of course there's that

stability improvement well regen braking

speaking of dynamics one thing that did

surprise me is that the single motor

version does not get a smaller tire size

than the dual motor version they both

get 245 with tires and they also get the

same interesting wheel trick the rear

wheels are actually one inch wider than

the front wheels that gives the vehicle

a little bit of a different driving

dynamic because it effectively stiffens

the sidewall on the tire in the rear

even though the tire itself is exactly

the same between the front and the back

now let's tackle charging and range

charging happens behind the charge door

right over here on the driver's side

just behind the rear passenger door

there's an onboard 11 kilowatt charger

so you could charge the battery

completely in about eight hours

depending on the power source that you

have availability with that's of course

from zero to one hundred percent most

folks aren't going to be doing that this

will definitely charge the average daily

commute in a relatively short window if

you have an 11 kilowatt capable evse dc

fast charging has now been bumped up to

155 kilowatts if you connect this to the

appropriate level 3 dc fast charger

that's a little bit faster than before

due to some refinements on the charge

control systems that update also applies

to 2021 model year polestars if you live

in a colder climate you're probably

going to want to select the heat pump

option in the Polestar 2 that could give

you an extra 10 bump in range depending

on the climate that you're in over a day

of driving i found the driver's seat

very comfortable but this new seat

design is a little bit interesting i'm

in the base version so we don't get

things like an extendable thigh cushion

and we don't get a power recline

function if i scoot this really close to

the steering wheel you can just barely

see the knob right here that's the seat

recline knob now what makes this unusual

is that we still get a four-way

adjustable lumbar support right there on

the seat and a two position seat memory

for the driver's seat the seat memory

just doesn't adjust the tilt of the seat

back we also have a tilt telescopic

steering column that's manual with a

decent range of motion rather than a

full manual passenger seat the passenger

seat has the same range of motion as the

driver's seat the only thing that's

missing is the two position memory when

you jump into the back seat it's

important to remember that the polestar

2 is on the small side for a compact

luxury sedan so we do find a little bit

less legroom back here than we find in

some other compact luxury options but

with the front seat all the way back in

its tracks i still have about two inches

of legroom left seating area back here

is pretty generous another change for

2022 is we can now get a traditional

steel roof so if you live in an area

with a really hot climate and you aren't

the biggest fan of that enormous sheet

of glass helping bake your head as you

drive down the road you can now get it

with a steel roof now that does seem to

cut back on rear seat headroom just a

little bit if i sit back all the way in

this seat my hair is brushing the

ceiling i have about half an inch of

headroom left we still have a bit of a

hump right there in the middle we'll

take a look at that in a bit but it's

not enormous if i move over to the

driver's side you can see i have a

little bit more legroom left with the

front seat comfortably adjusted for me

at six feet tall pulstar has done a

really decent job packaging the battery

they utilize some of that space right

there in the center tunnel for a battery

but you can see that they didn't inflate

the center tunnel like we see in for

instance a toyota mirai where it has an

absolutely enormous tunnel back there

behind the power sportback cargo space

comes in at just over 14 cubic feet you

should know that the wade companies

measure cargo area varies from company

to company because there are a number of

different standards but the 14 cubic

feet appears to be under this rigid

cargo cover right here in the cargo area

so the trunk size in here is actually

going to be a little bit bigger and more

practical than you'd otherwise think if

you're comparing this to a sedan you

could of course remove this hard cargo

cover and put a lot more cargo in here

you could even put things like barbecues

from a trip to home depot or lowe's but

as you can see there's not quite as much

room just above there as there would be

in a full-on suv or crossover under the

hood there's a little bit of additional

storage space but not a great deal you

couldn't really put carry-on luggage

back here under this cargo divider lift

that up we find the tow hook can affix

the flat and of course the inflator kit

when it comes to the exclusive alex and

autos truck come for index the Polestar 2

scores pretty well because there's also

some additional storage space right here

under the load floor now the way that

this is shaped it's not exactly usable

for things like a spare tire or any kind

of roller luggage but you could

certainly squeeze soft sided luggage

right down there

here's a better look at what polstar is

calling the steel roof obviously it's

steel on the outside fabric on the

inside with this interior polestar is

really focusing on environmental

friendliness so a lot of recycled

materials recyclable materials vegan

materials etc although you can still get

napa leather if you want to the driver

and front pastor get high adjustable

shoulder belts as well as height

adjustable headrests this is the base

interior fabric it's stain resistant and

has some really cool geometric patterns

going on aside from the manual recline

adjustment these seats feature a very

similar design to the rest of the

Polestar 2 seats so pretty aggressive

bolstering they're definitely nice and

grippy the front seats are heated

ventilated seats are available in the

Polestar 2 but obviously not with the

fabric seats moving over to the front

seats we find a lot of premium materials

fabric for the speaker grilles right

there a sort of wetsuit like material

right there for the armrest and around

that grab handle soft touch materials at

the top of the door and harder plastics

down there around the bottle holders a

change on the interior for 2022 is that

we get a bit more texture so the base

model has some different trim with these

little dimples in it fabric insert right

there soft touch materials above this

definitely has a very luxurious very

volvo like quality interior the large

tablet-like screen is the first

implementation of google's android

automotive operating system not to be

confused with android auto android auto

is a phone projection system where your

phone is projecting an android window

into an infotainment screen this entire

infotainment screen is actually running

the google android operating system now

there are a few features that the

software lacks at this exact moment

apple carplay is still something that's

coming later as is sirius xm satellite

radio but what's interesting is that

this vehicle already has all the

hardware for all of that including the

sirius xm hardware that was also on the

2021 pulstar vehicles so you'll be able

to add siriusxm via a software update

later the software is really snappy it's

definitely easy to use and there's going

to be an app store where you can add

apps yourself you can also create apps

apparently and just dump them onto the

system if you want to so for instance

pulstar created a press drive route app

for us to use in this system you'll

actually be able to get a developer

toolkit from google so you can develop

your own apps right here and then have

them pushed to the app store rather

unfortunately i can't show you the app

store because i don't have any

connectivity but you can see we have

spotify the bluetooth media player radio

npr one there they're a bunch of

different streaming apps and pulstar

says that they are also developing some

games to be used within the system so

the system's graphics processor and main

processor are capable of doing that kind

of gaming function just above the

infotainment screen we find a center

channel speaker two air vents right

there you'll notice that there are not

air vents lower for the driver and front

passenger more of that trim no start

stop button this is like other modern

evs where you simply put your foot on

the brake

use this shifter right over here to

shift it into gear and then off you

drive when you want to turn off you just

hit park open the door walk away and the

car turns off over here we have a power

and volume knob

play pause right there button for the

defogger and defroster two usb charge

ports right there you can see those

charge ports one of them is an interface

port for the system

right there but the software again is

not quite ready for android auto and

apple carplay that's where you plug it

in we have a qi wireless charging map

there and you can see more of that trim

around that shifter area this is not a

double tap shifter this is a single pull

so we just pull back for drive push all

the way forward for reverse and there's

a little bit of middle detent for

neutral between the front seats we find

one cup holder this cup holder

arrangement does strike me as a little

bit odd for north america and then there

is one more cup holder right back there

but you have to open this center armrest

for that and if you would rather use

that second cup holder for storage you

can remove that but obviously you can't

use the two at the same time in case

you're wondering this is what the pull

star key looks like it looks very much

like the volvo key with the buttons

right there on the side an interesting

touch you'll notice when you have that

center console open is that we have a

little airbag sticker right there on the

front seats both of them because these

front seats contain a side impact airbag

for the center of the vehicle in the

event of a side impact collision you'd

get the standard curtain airbags coming

down over there and you would get a

curtain airbag basically that pops out

of the seat on this side and on the

driver's seat over here as well that

keeps you from bumping noggins in the

event of that side impact on either side

of the center console there are also

some additional storage areas on the

driver's side we have a full lcd

instrument cluster that gives us two

basic views one with a moving map

display and one without one thing that i

appreciate is this power and charge

gauge it's difficult to demonstrate when

i'm stationary but hopefully i'll be

able to demonstrate that in the drive

section obviously power this line moves

over here and it shows you how much

oomph you're using from the battery

battery level is right over here on the

right side but the charge side is what i

find interesting because it'll actually

tell you when the vehicle is going to

start to engage the friction brakes so

it'll turn orange as it goes over there

to the left and then it will enter sort

of a hashed area as the friction breaks

actually engage that helps you really

control how much regen you're getting

there are no updates to the steering

wheel so this is the same three-spoke

model that we saw before the controls

for the adaptive cruise control system

is over here on the left the controls

for the infotainment system and that

multi-function lcd are over there on the

right and then we have a split bottom

spoke right there let's talk about the

dual motor model out on the road first

acceleration is definitely brisk if i

come to a complete stop here we

definitely get very aggressive

acceleration you can really feel

yourself getting pressed back in the

seat the acceleration is very tesla-like

this particular model goes 0-60 in 4.3

seconds that is definitely very very

swift but perhaps more important than

that 0-60 time is the directness of the

acceleration very much like modern

teslas when you press the accelerator

pedal you get a lot of um fight away

this does not weight and ramp power

slowly so in that respect this feels a

little bit different than the volvo xc40

ev that ramps power a little bit more

slowly here with the polestar they were

being much more aggressive and this

really has an interesting feel to it as

a result the other thing you'll notice

is that as i've said before

the best way in my head to describe the

way the Polestar 2 feels out on the road

is

this is exactly what would happen in my

mind if bmw was tasked at designing

building engineering tuning etc a tesla

model 3 but they had access to volvo's

parts bin because a lot of the

components in here feel very volvo the

seats definitely feel volvo the steering

wheel looks like a volvo steering wheel

with the polestar logo right there but

this does not feel like a volvo out on

the road this feels an awful lot like

i would say electric bmw 3 series to be

perfectly honest the suspension system

is tuned a little bit more gently than

the tesla model threes this doesn't have

that same sort of firm and bouncy feel

unless you get the performance version

then that suspension is definitely

stiffer and you get that sort of firm

bobble feeling going on but there's

definitely enough suspension travel in

this suspension design to soak up some

of the larger bumps out on the road that

i'm on and then of course you get that

really direct accelerator feel now

polstar has chosen to tune this

drivetrain to send more power to the

rear unless all the power is called for

so obviously if this is floored then we

have a symmetrical power setup where we

get 408 horsepower total coming from the

two electric motors but in a lot of

driving situations it'll actually be

sending more power to the rear when it

comes to handling the Polestar 2 does

extremely well if you get the model with

the performance package according to

polestar it will pull 0.9 gs on a skid

pad that is very very good for a modern

electric vehicle especially with 245

with tires on it that is definitely

better than what we see in the current

ford mustang machi although i don't know

what the mock egt will be like and

that's kind of sort of a competitor to

this because the truth is that even

though it has a ford logo on the front

and the pricing scheme is a little bit

different on the maki

because they're evs and they're both

performance evs there's definitely going

to be at least a little bit of cross

shop there's also obviously going to be

cross shop with the tesla model 3. but i

prefer the way this suspension is tuned

in the Polestar 2. it gives us a lot of

the benefits of the model 3 the

directness of the acceleration the low

center of gravity that that definite

feeling of ev stickiness out on the road

and secure and stable handling but

actually dials the fun up a little bit i

prefer the way the steering is tuned in

the Polestar 2 as well the steering is a

little bit too twitchy a little bit too

quick in the model 3. now a lot of

people get confused about this so before

anybody flames me out down there in the

comments section i'm not talking about

assist assist is adjustable in this and

it's adjustable in the model 3 but you

can never adjust the steering ratio in

the model 3 that's a gear in the

steering rack and that's not adjustable

because it's actually a gear and what i

mean is that there are more turns locked

to lock with this steering wheel and so

it feels a little bit less video gamey a

little bit less twitchy out on the road

it's easier to keep it centered you

don't feel like you're constantly

adjusting course the other thing you'll

notice versus the model 3 is that wind

noise is much better controlled than the

Polestar 2 all the panel gaps are very

well aligned around the vehicle and this

model does not have the glass roof which

does seem to be a little bit quieter

because obviously there's more

insulation ability when you have steel

some insulation and then some fabric

right here now let's talk about what

everybody's here for the single motor

version if i just come to a complete

stop i'm on a winding mountain road here

and i floor it

we don't have full power yet full

powerful there were 30 miles an hour

approximately is where the full 230

horsepower seems to come on at least

according to the power gauge and that

makes sense because if volvo allowed you

to have 231 horsepower and over 230

pound feet of torque on the front axle

instantly you'd get an awful lot of

front wheel slip and so unlike the

Polestar 2 dual motor they ramp the power

up more gently like we see in other evs

and that's one of the disadvantages to

having the motor on the front if polstar

had put the motor in the rear like we

see some other evs out there you'd be

able to get on the throttle a little bit

more rapidly between zero and about 25

miles an hour acceleration may be a

little bit more sluggish than some of

the rear wheel drive competition but

over 25 it's going to be substantially

similar 0-60 in this particular model

happened in about seven seconds i wasn't

able to test this on a perfectly level

surface and of course i'm not at home so

be sure and keep that in mind because i

will have this at home for a complete

weekly review just as soon as i can

possibly get my hands on it the other

thing you're going to notice with the

front wheel drive drivetrain is that

there is just a little bit of torque

steer it's very well controlled for a

vehicle with this much oomph in it but

as you come out of these corners

especially if it's a little bit slippery

in the corner and you floor it you'll

definitely feel the front wheels tug a

little bit in neutral handling

situations where you're going around a

corner power off this feels identical to

the dual motor version because other

than the lack of the rear motor it is

identical to the dual motor version we

have the same tire sizes the same tires

245 with tires all the way around and

they even still have the staggered wheel

setup where the rear wheels are wider

than the front wheels the weight balance

does change a little bit the dual motor

version is nearly 50 50 when it comes to

weight balance and this is about 55 45

or so because 200 pounds is missing from

the rear the rear electronics module and

the rear electric motor seem to weigh

about 180 200 pounds or so as far as

ride quality goes it's basically the

same cabin quietness ditto you can't

really hear the electric drivetrain

unlike other evs there's really no hum

from that electric motor or the battery

systems it's definitely very well hushed

this model also does not have the glass

roof so it's just as quiet when it comes

to wind noise as i said earlier in the

video the big benefit of having the

electric motor up front rather than in

the rear is regeneration ability as well

as stability while the regen is on regen

is very aggressive in this single motor

version almost as aggressive as the dual

motor version and that's actually quite

logical because in the dual motor

version the front electric motor is the

one doing most of the regen braking

you'll definitely notice the difference

out on a windy road like this if you're

coming into a corner hot and regen is on

high in a rear regen vehicle you can

sometimes get the rear end to step out a

little bit awkwardly especially if the

road surface is not absolutely perfect

and we don't see that in the Polestar

2. it's just a breaking dynamics thing

clearly this is just a practical

rational limitation because in any rear

motor ev you could crank that regen dial

up to 11 and have massive amounts of

regen on the rear axle it's just going

to exacerbate that driving dynamic and

that braking dynamic issue that's not

something that we see in a vehicle like

this so if you live in a colder climate

theoretically that's what the Polestar 2

is also designed for this is going to be

more sure-footed in terms of going

uphills and going downhills and that

regen breaking feeling it's also going

to get more power into the battery i've

just gone from about 10 000 feet i'm

going down to 5000 feet here and i

haven't hit the brake pedal once now

this vehicle does have a blended braking

system so unlike modern tesla's where

you just have the throttle lift off part

i can actually adjust the amount of

regen i want here in the system i can

choose off low standard and then i can

choose whether i want the vehicle to

creep when i let my foot off of the

brake pedal or not i really love the

fact that this has blended braking

because if you're going downhill like

this and you want a more traditional

feel you can control the regen with just

your foot on the brake pedal you aren't

limited to just that throttle lift off

regen and again it is quite aggressive

now i've got to admit to all of you that

even though i completely understand the

engineering rationale behind putting the

electric motor just on the front axle i

kind of wish they'd put it just on the

rear axle because it would have made

this likely a little bit faster and a

little bit more fun when you're out in

your favorite winding mountain road but

again there would be compromises in

regent ability there would be

compromises in braking dynamics

there would be compromises likely in the

epa efficiency cycle and probably a

little bit of a compromise when it comes

to range and gosh that sounds like an

awful lot of compromises but for the fun

nature of the vehicle i think i would

have wanted it on the rear axle that

also i think would have helped

differentiate it a little bit from

perhaps volvo's future ev products which

are probably going to play it safe and

put the motor on the front axle for a

single motor version

and i also think it would have been in

keeping with the character because the

dual motor version of this is just so so

much fun and it has a definite rear

power bias they definitely decided that

when you stab the throttle

now let's get to the nitty gritty the

Polestar 2 is going to start at 45

900 for 2022 that's less expensive than

last year because we now have base

models in dual motor and in single motor

format obviously the lowest price tag is

gonna be for the single motor like the

one that's right next to me visually

they are identical to one another the

only way you'll be able to tell is the

sticker on the front doors if you peel

it off nobody out there in the parking

lot is going to know that you spent less

the cost for the dual motor upgrade is

actually quite reasonable surprisingly

so that's gonna set you back forty nine

thousand nine hundred dollars so it's

just four thousand dollars extra to get

408 horsepower zero to sixty in under

four and a half seconds and really be

more fun than the base model to be

perfectly honest it's not that this

isn't fun it handles just like the

regular model in fact driving them back

to back out on a winding mountain road i

really had troubles telling them apart

except when you pressing the accelerator

pedal then you're going to get more

torque steer obviously more front wheel

scramble and it's not going to be as

quick so if i were shopping for a

Polestar 2 i would simply get the dual

motor version i think 49 900 is

especially reasonable when you realize

that this qualifies for the full 7 500

federal tax credit that's going to make

a pollstar 2 considerably less expensive

for most stoppers out there than a

comparably priced model three because at

the moment most eevee shoppers

especially luxury ev shoppers are going

to qualify for that full 7 500 tax

credit now on the other hand if you're

looking at the base model and you're

thinking 35 000

maybe i could upgrade from a camry into

something like a pulstar keep in mind

you have to have a minimum of a 7 500

federal tax liability in order to max

that credit out and you have to qualify

for the other state local and regional

incentives if you want the heat pump

that's newly available on the Polestar 2

you have to add the plus pack to the

base model that's a 4 000 bump in

addition to the heat pump we get the

glass roof so you can't have the steel

roof with that particular option we get

heated rear seats and we get a number of

other interior tweaks like an upgraded

audio system the pilot pack for thirty

two hundred dollars brings you upgraded

headlights you get the level two driver

assistance system that's available on

the Polestar 2 and adaptive cruise

control blind spot warning and rear

cross traffic detection some of those

active safety features again are not

standard on the base versions of the

Polestar 2. and if you want to get

carried away with options you can of

course add the performance package which

brings you the adjustable old dampers

the interior touches the brake upgrades

etc all of that is still available and

you can still get an apple leather

interior with ventilated seats if that's

something that you're interested in

although polestar has expanded the

number of options and packages available

for 2022 you'll notice that there aren't

as many standalone options or as many

option packages available as with some

of the european competition and a lot of

that has to do with the way the polestar

2 is sold at the moment in the us there

are about 25 Polestar spaces as they're

calling the dealers they are still

franchise dealers by the end of the year

there will be 30. polestar is only

targeting major metro areas in the

united states where ev adoption seems to

be on the rise so if you live in middle

of nowhere nebraska it's probably going

to be a while until you find a polestar

space near you you should also know that

the purchase experience is going to be a

little bit different than buying a volvo

or a bmw or a mercedes you'll go to the

polestar space and as of this year they

will now have a very small local

inventory of cars available if you

absolutely need a Polestar today right

now that dealer should be able to assist

you with getting into a pull start today

if however you're willing to wait say a

week to two weeks then what they'll do

is they'll try and match up the

configuration that you would like with

what's available at the port it's

already in the united states it will

then get shipped over to that polestar

dealer and then be delivered to you if

on the other hand you want a very

specific configuration of Polestar

perhaps the absolute base trim with the

least expensive color option or perhaps

an absolutely fully loaded most

expensive Polestar 2 you may have to

wait because it may have to get built

shipped to the united states they're all

manufactured in china at the moment and

then of course shipped onto the dealer

if you're not interested in visiting a

pulstar space that's not a problem you

can complete your purchase online the

vehicle can be delivered to you and they

can even make arrangements for a

trade-in online service is going to be

handled in a very similar way you simply

make your appointment online they'll

either pick up the vehicle and take it

to a service center dropping off a

loaner vehicle for you in the process or

they will actually repair the vehicle

right on site if it's something that can

be done that way it kind of depends on

where you are at least for the moment

the Polestar 2 is one of my favorite new

evs in america this is a ton of fun to

drive and it doesn't feel like some of

the other big battery evs out on the

road this definitely has a firm sporty

suspension tuned to it but it doesn't

feel bouncy like we see in the ford

mustang machi or the tesla model 3 or

the tesla model y they've definitely

spent a lot of time refining the

suspension tuning and thanks to the

design of this vehicle and the fact that

it's related to something like the volvo

xc40 the suspension has a little bit

more travel and that's part of why this

is not quite as low slung as something

like a model three you'll notice that

the hood is a little bit higher and the

rear trunk area or lift back area

whatever you want to call it is

definitely a little bit higher off the

ground as well obviously the boxier

shape gives up a little bit of

aerodynamic efficiency but i think the

payoffs are definitely worth it and i

also like the style let me know what you

think about all that down there in the

comment section below but i would say

bottom line if you're looking at a pulse

r2 and you're considering the single

motor really trying to choose between

the single motor and the dual motor

unless you really really are on a tight

budget i would simply get the dual motor

version it is heaps of fun it is a

surprising amount more fun than the

single motor version and four thousand

dollars isn't a great deal when we're

talking about a vehicle that's already

going to be up there towards fifty

thousand dollars let me know what you

think about all that down there in the

comments section below and of course

stay tuned because i will have my hands

on this for a full and complete drive

review just as soon as possible i'll see

all of you later

you
