i feel like these days a lot of people

really are

intrigued about the idea of getting out

of their internal combustion engine car

and into an ev but they just need that

little extra push that bit of intrigue

that bit of added interest

above the drivetrain in order to do that

and with that

i give you the Polestar 2.

[Music]

the first thing about the Polestar 2

that makes it intriguing is that

it's not an suv it might be based off

the

xc40 platform but unlike the e-tron and

the mercedes

this is a hatchback and a pretty

spacious one

look at that

then there's the overall design of it

which is well

simple but really quite elegant and

striking i think it certainly gets an

awful lot of looks

there's a sort of slab-sided big volume

to it

which in pictures makes it seem well

pretty huge but actually in real life

it's nice and compact it's actually

shorter than

a bmw 3 series i also love this they

call it the visor graphic

on the side of the car which reminds me

of well

another swedish manufacturer sadly no

longer with us

surely this is the modern incarnation of

a saab the Polestar 2 is of course not

made in sweden it's made in china

because

Geely owns volvo and therefore polestar

but coming back to the scandinavian

norse angle bit of norse mythology in

here

thor's hammer in the front lights it's

pretty good isn't it and around the back

they've got 288 leds in the rear lights

and they look a bit like a kit from

knight rider one other thing i just want

to mention whilst we're out here

the badge look at that it's just it's a

really

cool piece of design i think i love the

fact that it's

it's matched to the body color of each

individual car it's just in matte rather

than gloss anyway let's

have a sit inside

[Applause]

the interior of this car is every bit as

intriguing and striking really

is the exterior we'll come back to the

big screen in a bit because i've got

more to say about that

but one of the taglines of this is vegan

as

standard so all the materials in here

are well vegan this is a vegan vinyl

look leather on the steering wheel these

materials here is nice it's quite

tactile actually it'll be intriguing to

see

how they all sort of wear and mark up

but it feels premium there is a key

but it's a fairly unattractive thing but

that's because in future

your phone will actually act as the key

so this will be fairly redundant

then there's no starter button because

this is

bum activated which is another thing if

you were a child you'd laugh at that

bob activated what that means is that

you just get in

put on the brake select drive and off

you can go

[Music]

first things first i'm going to tell you

a little bit about the route that we're

going to drive today because

just over there is grunden which is a

substation on the national grid in fact

it's on the line

of the first ever 400 kilovolt

electricity lines installed in the uk

in 1965. now we need to end up at

millbrook and this

line goes from there all the way down

just past the end of

the millbrook proving ground so i

thought we'd follow it across country

in case you hadn't worked that out it's

because the car's electric you see

electricity lines following the

electricity down

i thought it was obvious

[Applause]

now the first thing you notice in here

is well the wing mirrors actually

they're brilliant they're frameless it's

such a simple thing

no cameras with screens here or anything

like that

but they allow them apparently to be 30

smaller so therefore more aerodynamic

and they just look so

clean and give you such a lovely image

then there's the actual sort of glass

house it feels quite airy in here

which is odd because it's quite a

shallow sort of opening there the dlo

the daylight opening

but because you've got the panoramic

roof which is standard

there's a yeah a nice sort of atmosphere

quite thin a-pillars and you've still

got that

wrap-around feeling to the view out

outlines

one of the things that i feel may draw

people to the Polestar 2 is

google you see this is the first car to

be designed with a google operating

system built in

what this means is that the voice

recognition system actually

works you can summon an address to

navigate to via google maps

or you can ask google to turn the heated

seats on or find test match special on

the radio or play track 9 of the oasis

album

what's the story morning glory it is of

course

she's electric if you have a home

suitably connected to a gmail account

then you can ask it to turn the lights

on or open the garage door in advance of

your arrival back at the castle

yes big brother is watching but it works

brilliantly

and frankly i feel a lot of other

manufacturers will be scrabbling to

catch up

pylons here's an interesting thing

actually they're called transmission

towers

but we all know them as pylons because

when the national grid was being set up

in the 1920s the country was obsessed

with

egypt and egyptology hey google

what's a pylon in egyptology the pylon

was the large gate at the front of the

temple

the walls of the pylon were decorated

with carved and painted scenes of the

pharaoh gods and goddesses

so now you know

[Applause]

[Music]

in terms of performance

this still has that electric car kick it

might not be the most powerful

but not to 62 in 4.7 seconds

which is pretty good given this weighs

2.1

tons it still has that absolute sort of

slightly unsettling surge from the

electric motors we've got one electric

motor in the front one at the back both

150 kilowatts so 300 kilowatts overall

which is 402

brake horsepower 487 pounds for the

torque

and yeah performance in a straight line

is

ample

from a driving perspective though what

really interests me

is the single pedal operation so

going to here then we have different

levels it's on standard

at the moment which is the strongest

amount of regenerative braking that you

can have

and from a performance aspect actually i

think your

throttle control would improve from

driving one of these because you have to

be really sensitive in the way that you

apply it and then lift off apply it

obviously because you've got that

instant torque and then lifting off

if you're not careful then the regen

will

get a very sort of jerky rise you need

to be just subtle about it but you can

do entire journeys without ever touching

the brake pedal it is

extraordinary it's quite odd to get used

to but i really really like it

and obviously you get more range if you

use stronger regen

talking of range the wltp figure for the

polestar is 292 miles

which is decent without being

exceptional and of course this is with

the 78 kilowatt-hour battery brimmed

when the recommendation is only to fill

to 80 in order to preserve the life of

the battery however

range anxiety can be alleviated by

google maps telling you very accurately

just how much battery it will have when

you arrive at your destination

or it can reach you via a charging point

to save you running out

i actually quite like the idea of just

taking a bit more time

sitting and having a coffee while you

charge up

hey google what's the best independent

coffee shop near here

the out of office coffee house on

marketplace is one mile away

that'll do

but although there is a big focus on the

range of specific cars

to me the bigger problem with evs at the

moment seems to be the charging network

without any unification of the different

charging points it all feels quite

confusing to someone newly inducted into

the ev sphere

you know there is a charging point down

the road from the coffee shop but then

you find that it's one that you're not

subscribed to

imagine only being allowed to fill up

with petrol at shell garages

alright i know it's not quite that bad

and for some there is the convenience of

charging at home

but from what i can see there is still

plenty of work to do in this area

let's talk about the big screen because

i'm not a fan of

screens in cars i like a physical button

and there are still some physical

buttons here so you've got the

the crucial things demist rear screen

volume

play and pause and then housing warning

lights they are all still

physical buttons down here the rest is

all done by this big screen

and it actually works

i know i'm staggered by it but it's

perfect it's set up in portrait

orientation which again

might seem a little odd that's obviously

like other cars we have seen but

it works and the reason for doing that

is because it's well it shows more on a

map because obviously if you're going

up the screen then that works better and

you can see further ahead with the map

and also because in terms of scrolling

you have longer lists so you don't

actually have to scroll as much you

don't have to touch the screen as much

when you know that it makes sense plus

people are used to looking at their

phones

so everything's kind of where you'd

expect in terms of sort of battery of

your phone

whether you've got 4g connection and all

that sort of thing

the other things are laid out nicely so

you've got the

the principal menus nicely

in your eye line just there so you're

not going to appear down here

and the buttons are big enough which is

perhaps the most crucial thing of all

because you don't want to be trying to

fiddle around

reaching for things that you just can't

quite where is it this menu down here

it works it's nice and simple nice and

easy to navigate

i actually like it the drive mode in

here we've got different options in

terms of steering feel

light standard firm firm feels best i

think and then

just the regen as i've said before so

off low or standard

oh and creep as well but i think if

you've got the regen on then you want

the creep

off because that way you can come to a

full stop with the regen

you don't need to touch the brake pedal

now as i said most of this car is well

as standard you get all of it thrown in

for your 46 thousand pounds but

there is one crucial option on this and

that is the performance pack

priced at 5 000 pounds it isn't cheap

but you do get

golden seat belts are actually yellow

you also get gold colored dust caps

so be careful where you park anyway more

pertinently to performance

you get larger 20-inch wheels bigger

brembo front brakes and perhaps most

intriguingly

olin's dual flow valve manually

adjustable dampers

the reason for the golden seat belts is

because they talk about

a golden ride that's what they're aiming

for in this the sort of ride you get and

think yes that is just

spot on have they achieved that

well i'm not sure in this performance

packed car

they have entirely so there are 22

clicks of adjustment

all round we're on 12 at the moment 22

being the softest

so we're kind of somewhere in the middle

and it is

pretty firm it just gets a bit bubbly

the big primary ride impacts are still

really well absorbed and you can tell

that they're sophisticated dampers there

is a

plushness there way that they soak up

the bigger bumps but

yes polestar wanted to set itself apart

from volvo

by not having quite the sort of the just

the smooth ride that they have

but even so i think most customers are

going to want slacking these off

why not go for an electrically

adjustable damper

because they said most people like the

idea of a

just having their own setting and once

they've found it they can just leave it

there

i like a passive damper i understand

that and it's quite intriguing again

it's another those things the screen

will interest some people

a set of you know manually adjustable

loaders dampers will certainly appeal to

other people

like me

i did actually try adjusting the dampers

and it's certainly not the work of a

moment

the fronts are easy enough as the knob

is on the bottom stop snickering

but the rears are rather tucked away up

behind the arch liners

i tried the comfort setting 18 on the

front and 20 on the rear

for a few miles and it was more

forgiving but certainly still no magic

carpet

ride so what's it actually

like to drive with its fancy olin

dampers is it

interactive and wriggling with feel

through the steering and

no it's not it's not those things it's a

nice sort of

clean car to drive you can say feel the

sophistication the dampers and the way

it leans into them and that's really

appealing i like that it does feel like

a heavy car

when you're driving it normally with the

regen that disguises the weight really

well i think but when you actually start

to push on when you have to use

the hydraulic brakes the big brembos at

the front

that's when you start to notice the 2.1

tonnes oh

in terms of adjustability the kind of

isn't benny really

it's just a case of dissecting a road

using

all that extreme grip and acceleration

and the precision of the chassis

definitely quick though

and here we are at millbrook the actual

line continues all the way on

down towards luton but we're stopping

here

[Music]

after a day with the Polestar 2 i found

myself thinking that if i was in the

market for an ev is a daily driver

then this is probably the one that i

would go for like most evs it's

afflicted with a hefty curb weight

also the driving experience only rises

to the levels of interesting

rather than actually tactile and

engaging like a hot hatch

despite the shall we say connected ride

of this performance pack car

however the looks the clever tech the

general sense of quality and even those

onlin dampers

are all things that make this

interesting and desirable

i suppose what i'm saying is that

perhaps the biggest compliment i can

give the Polestar to

is that it's covetable regardless of its

powertrain
